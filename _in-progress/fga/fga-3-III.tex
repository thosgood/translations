\section*{Introduction}
\oldpage{212-01}

The problems discussed in the current expos\'{e} differ from those discussed in the two previous ones, in that we try to represent certain covariant, no longer contravariant, functors of varying schemes.
The procedure of passing to the quotient is, however, essential in many questions of construction in algebraic geometry, including those from expos\'{e}s~I and II (\cite{1}, \cite{2}).
Indeed, the question of \emph{effectiveness of a descent data} on a $T$-prescheme $X$, with respect to a faithfully flat and quasi-compact morphism $T\to S$, is equivalent to the question of existence of a quotient of $X$ (satisfying reasonable properties that we examine below) by the flat equivalence relation on $X$ defined by the descent data;
the questions raised in \cite[A.2.c]{1} can probably be answered at the same time as the questions posed in \hyperref[2]{\S2} of this current expos\'{e}.
Similarly, the \emph{Picard scheme} (for the definition, see \cite[C.3]{2}) of an $S$-scheme $X$ can be defined in many ways, such as as a quotient of certain other schemes (with positive divisors, or immersions into a projective) by flat equivalence relations, with the definition and construction of these auxiliary schemes being also more simple: they are basically schemes of the type $\Hom_S(X,Y)$, and variants defined in \cite[C.2]{2}, and their construction will be the subject of the following expos\'{e} (under suitable hypotheses of projectivity).
Thus, combining the results of the current expos\'{e} with those of the following, we will obtain the construction of Picard schemes, under suitable hypotheses.

The problem of passing to the quotient in preschemes again offers unresolved questions.
The most important is mentioned in \hyperref[8]{\S8}.
It currently remains as the only obstacle to the construction of \emph{schemes of modules over the integers for curves of arbitrary degree}, \emph{polarised abelian varieties}, etc.
That is to say, its solution deserves the efforts of specialists of algebraic groups.

\section{Equivalence relations, effective equivalence relations}

Let $\cal{C}$ be a category, and $X$ an object of $\cal{C}$.
A pair of morphisms
\[
  p_1,p_2\colon R\rightrightarrows X,
\]
is said to be an ``\emph{equivalence pair}'' in $\cal{C}$, with \emph{target} $X$ and \emph{source} $R$, if, for every object $T$ of $\cal{C}$, the corresponding maps
\[
  p_1(T),p_2(T)\colon R(T)\rightrightarrows X(T)
\]
(where we set $Y(T)=\Hom(T,Y)$ for any object $Y$ of $\cal{C}$) define a map
\[
  R(T)\to X(T)\times X(T)
\]
that induces a bijection from $R(T)$ to the graph of an equivalence relation on the set $X(T)$.
We introduce an evident equivalence relation on equivalence pairs with target $X$, and call an equivalence class an \emph{equivalence $\cal{C}$-relation} on $X$, or simply an equivalence relation if no confusion may arise.

If $X\times X$ exists, then the data of an equivalence relation on $X$ is equivalent to the data of a sub-object $R$ of $X\times X$ such that, for every object $T$ of $\cal{C}$, the subset of $(X\times X)(T)=X(T)\times X(T)$ that corresponds to $R(T)$ is the graph of an equivalence relation on $X(T)$.
Denoting the morphisms from $R$ to $X$ induced by the projections $\pr_1$ and $\pr_2$ by $p_1$ and $p_2$ (respectively), the above condition says that $(p_1,p_2)$ is an equivalence pair.
We can also express the axioms of a set-theoretical equivalence relation for the $R(T)$ in the $X(T)$ diagrammatically in $\cal{C}$ (under the assumption that both $X\times X$ and the fibre product $(R,p_2)\times_X(R,p_1)$ exist), following the general principle of \cite[A.1]{2}.
We will not need this.

Every time that we have a pair of morphisms $(p_1,p_2)$ with the same source $R$ and the same target $X$, we can define the \emph{cokernel} of the pair as an object $Y$ of $\cal{C}$ that represents the contravariant (in $Z$) functor
\[
  \Hom_{p_1,p_2}(X,Z)
\]
which denotes the set of morphisms $u$ from $X$ to $Z$ such that $up_1=up_2$.
If $Y$ exists, then it is determined up to unique isomorphism.
We will denote it by $Y/(p_1,p_2)$, or, by an abuse of notation, $Y/R$, with the latter mostly being used when
\oldpage{212-03}
$(p_1,p_2)$ is an equivalence pair: it is then common to identify, in notation, the equivalence relation defined by the pair with the one defined by $R$.
Note that, if we consider $Y$ as a quotient of $X$, then it depends only on the equivalence relation defined by the pair $(p_1,p_2)$

We now start with a morphism
\[
  f\colon X\to Y
\]
which allows us to consider $X$ as an ``object over $Y$'', and we suppose that the fibre product
\[
  \cal{R}(f) = X\times_Y X
\]
exists.
Let $p_1$ and $p_2$ be its projections.
Then $(p_1,p_2)$ is an equivalence pair, and is said to be \emph{associated} with the morphism $f$.
It thus defines an equivalence relation, and is said to be \emph{associated} with the morphism $f$.

We say that a pair of morphisms $(p_1,p_2)$ with target $X$, and source $R$, is an \emph{effective equivalence pair} if
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item the cokernel $Y=X/(p_1,p_2)$ exists ;
  \item the fibre product $X\times_Y X$ exists ; and
  \item the morphism $R\to X\times_Y X$ with components $p_1$ and $p_2$ is an isomorphism.
\end{enumerate}
Then the pair $(p_1,p_2)$ is indeed an equivalence pair.
We also say that the equivalence relation that it defines is an \emph{effective equivalence relation}.

We say that a morphism $f\colon X\to Y$ is an \emph{effective epimorphism} if
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item the fibre product $R=X\times_Y X$ exists ;
  \item the quotient $X/(p_1,p_2)$ exists, where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the projections from $R$ to $X$ ; and
  \item the morphism $X/(p_1,p_2)\to Y$ induced by $f$ is an isomorphism.
\end{enumerate}
Then $f$ is indeed an epimorphism, and even a strict epimorphism (cf. \cite[A.2.3]{1}), with the converse being true if the fibre product $X\times_Y X$ exists.
We also say that the quotient object of $X$ defined by the epimorphism $f$ is an \emph{effective quotient} of $X$.

The above definitions imply the following ``\emph{Galois correspondence}'':

\oldpage{212-04}
\begin{itenv}{Proposition 1.1}
\label{proposition1.1}
  There is a bijective correspondence, respecting the natural orders, between the set of effective equivalence relations $R$ on $X$ and the set of effective quotients $Y$ of $X$, with such an $R$ corresponding to the effective quotient $X/R$, and such a $Y$ corresponding to the effective equivalence relation defined by the canonical projection $X\to Y$ (which is defined by the fibre product $X\times_Y X$ endowed with its two projections).
\end{itenv}

In very nice categories (sets, sheaves of sets, etc.), every quotient is effective, and every equivalence relation is effective.
This is no longer true in categories such as the category of preschemes over a given prescheme $S$, not even if $S$ is the spectrum of field, nor even if we restrict to finite schemes over $S$.
The question of effectiveness, and even (in the case of non-finite preschemes over $S$) the question of existence of quotients, more often than not turn out to be delicate.


\section{Example: finite preschemes over \texorpdfstring{$S$}{S}}
\label{2}

Let $\cal{C}$ be the category of finite preschemes over $S$, which is assumed to be locally Noetherian.
Then $\cal{C}$ is equivalent to the opposite category of the category of coherent sheaves of commutative algebras on $S$, or, if $S$ is affine of ring $A$, then it is equivalent to the opposite category of the category of finite $A$-algebras over $A$ (i.e. those that are modules of finite type over $A$).
We thus immediately conclude that, in $\cal{C}$, finite projective limits and finite inductive limits exist.
This is well known (without any finiteness hypotheses) for the former;
the fibre product of preschemes $X$ and $Y$ over $S$ corresponds to the tensor product $B\otimes_A C$ of corresponding algebras, and the kernel of two morphisms $X\rightrightarrows Y$, defined by two $A$-algebra homomorphisms $u,v\colon C\rightrightarrows B$, corresponds to the quotient of $B$ by the ideal generated by the $u(v)-v(c)$, etc.
For finite inductive limits, it suffices to consider, on one hand, finite sums, which correspond to the ordinary product of $A$-algebras, and, on the other hand, cokernels of pairs of morphisms $X\rightrightarrows Y$, which correspond (as we can immediately see) to the sub-ring of $C$ given by elements where the homomorphisms $u,v\colon C\rightrightarrows B$ agree (with this sub-ring being finite over $A$ thanks to the Noetherian hypothesis).
We also note that we can show, using the Noetherian hypothesis, that finite inductive limits, and, in particular, quotients, thus constructed in the category $\cal{C}$ of finite preschemes over $S$ are, in fact, quotients in the category of \emph{all} preschemes.

\oldpage{212-05}
As we mentioned in \cite{1}, \emph{there are non-effective epimorphisms in $\cal{C}$} (or even non-strict, which is the same, since fibre products exist).
\emph{I do not know if equivalence relations are still effective} if we have no flatness hypothesis.
I have only obtained, in this direction, very partial, positive, results, that are vital for the proof of the fundamental theorem of the formal theory of modules (cf. \cite[B, Theorem~1]{2}).
We note that it is easy, in the given problem, to reduce to the case where $S$ is the spectrum of a local Artinian ring, with an algebraically closed residue field.
But even if $A$ is a field, the answer is not known.

We can also consider the case of a prescheme $X$ over $S$ that is no longer assumed to be finite over $S$, but by considering an equivalence relation $R$ on $X$ such that $p_1\colon R\to X$ is a finite morphism.
We then say that $R$ is a \emph{finite equivalence relation}.
Supposing, for simplicity, that $S$ and $X$ are affine (which implies that $R$ is affine, so that the situation is reduced to one of pure commutative algebra), \emph{we do not know, even in this case, if there exists a quotient $X/R=Y$, and if the canonical morphism $X\to Y$ is finite}.
(The most simple case is that where we suppose that $S$ is the spectrum of a field $k$, and where $X$ is the spectrum of $k[t]$, i.e. the affine line).
Of course, if the two problems above turn out to be true, then we can conclude that, in the situation described, $R$ is effective.
Note that the problem of \emph{existence} of a quotient $Y$ and of the \emph{finiteness} of $f\colon X\to Y$ are stated in exactly the same terms if, instead of an equivalence graph in $X$, we only have an equivalence pregraph in $X$, in the sense of \hyperref[4]{\S4}.

The question of passing to the quotient by a more or less arbitrary finite equivalence relation arises in the construction of preschemes by ``gluing'' given preschemes $X_i$ along certain closed sub-preschemes;
the gluing law is expressed precisely by a finite equivalence relation on the prescheme $X$ given by the sum of the $X_i$.
We also expect that the solutions of the problems stated here, as well as of their many variations, will be a preliminary condition for the clarification of a general technique for non-projective constructions, in the direction introduced in \cite{2}.

The only general positive fact known to the author is the following:

\begin{itenv}{Proposition 2.1}
\label{proposition2.1}
  Let $S$ be a locally Noetherian prescheme, $s$ a point of $S$, and $\Omega$ an algebraically closed extension of $k(s)$.
  Consider the
\oldpage{212-06}
  corresponding ``fibre functor'' $F$, that associates, to any $S$-scheme $X$ that is finite over $S$, the set of points of $X/S$ with values in $\Omega$.
  This functor (which is trivially left exact) is \emph{right exact}, i.e. it commutes with finite inductive limits, and, in particular, with the cokernel of pairs of morphisms.
\end{itenv}

By using this result for all the ``geometric points'' of $S$, we thus deduce that the ``quotient'' category $\cal{C}'$ of $\cal{C}$, given by arguing ``modulo surjective radicial morphisms'' (i.e. by formally adjoining inverses for such morphisms), is a ``geometric'' category, i.e. it satisfies the same ``finite nature'' properties as the category of sets.
In particular, every equivalence relation is effective.
This implies that, if $R$ is an equivalence relation on $X$, where $X$ is finite over $S$, then the canonical morphism $R\to X\times_Y X$ (where $Y=X/R$) is \emph{radicial and surjective} (and, in fact, a surjective closed immersion, since it is a monomorphism).
