# Introduction

\oldpage{127}We consider the standard torus $T^2=\RR^2/\ZZ^2$ endowed with its $\CCinfty$ differential structure.
The projection onto $T^2$ of a line $y=\alpha x$ of $\RR$ defines a one-parameter subgroup of $T^2$ denoted $[\alpha]$.
The quotient group is denoted $T_\alpha=T^2/[\alpha]$, and its quotient topology is the trivial one.
The study of singular objects, of which $T_\alpha$ is the most well known example, has provoked the development of different techniques, algebraic or geometric, such as, amongst others: $C^*$-algebras ([@3] and [@7]), $Q$-varieties [@1], and analytic schemes [@2].
We want to illustrate here the technique of *diffeological spaces*, initially developed by J.-M. Souriau for the study of groups of infinite dimension, but which applies to all quotients (possibly singular) of Lie groups.
The quotient $T_\alpha$ can be endowed with the structure of a diffeological group (we refer to the references [@8] and [@4] for the details concerning this notion).
This structure agrees with the canonical Lie group structure if $\alpha$ is rational.
Here this structure is characterised by the following definition [@8]:

> $f\in\DL(\RR^n,T_\alpha)$ if and only if $f$ is defined on an open $\Omega$ of $\RR^n$ with values in $T_\alpha$ and satisfies the following condition: for all $x$ in $\Omega$, there exists an open neighbourhood $V$ of $x$, and a map $F\in\CCinfty(V,T^2)$ that lifts $f$, i.e. on $V$ we have the relation
> $$
>   P_\alpha\circ F
>   = f.
> \tag{1}
> $$

In the above, $P_\alpha$ is the canonical epimorphism from $T^2$ to $T_\alpha$, and $\DL(\RR^n,T_\alpha)$ is by definition the family of differentiable maps of opens in $\RR^n$ to $T_\alpha$ (also called *$n$-plots* of $T_\alpha$).
THe set of $n$-plots as $n$ runs over $\NN$ characterises the diffeological structure of $T_\alpha$.

The differentiable maps from $T_\alpha$ to a "diffeological space" $E$ are the maps $\varphi\colon T_\alpha\to E$ such that, for every plot $f$ of $T_\alpha$, the composite $\varphi\circ f$ is a plot of $E$.
In particular, the diffeomorphisms from $T_\alpha$ to $E$ are the bi-differentiable bijections.

For every diffeological group and every homogeneous space (quotient of a diffeological group by an arbitrary subgroup) we can define the notion of connectivity, and thus simple connectivity.
In the connected case, we can also define the universal covering and the fundamental group, which depend only on the diffeological structure ([@4] and [@8]).

We illustrate these techniques in the precise case of irrational windings of the torus.
The passage to the universal covering of these quotients allows us to give a complete diffeological classification;
we can also make explicit the group of diffeomorphisms of $T_\alpha$.
\oldpage{128}For the classification, there is agreement with the results obtained by the theory of $C^*$-algebras (cf. [@3] and [@7]);
we also find a similar classification starting from schemes of varieties [@2].


# Covering and fundamental group

We briefly describe the construction of the universal covering of a homogeneous diffeological space:

> Let $G$ be a connected diffeological group, and $p\colon\widetilde{G}\to G$ its universal covering.
> Let $H$ be an arbitrary subgroup of $G$;
> set $\widetilde{H}=p^{-1}(H)$, and let $\widetilde{H}_0$ be its identity component.
> We have the diagram
> $$
>   \begin{CD}
>     \widetilde{G} @>>> \widetilde{G}/\widetilde{H}_0
>   \\@VVV @VVV
>   \\G @>>> G/H
>   \end{CD}
> \tag{2}
> $$
> and $\widetilde{G}/\widetilde{H}_0$ is then the universal covering of $G/H$, and $\widetilde{H}/\widetilde{H}_0$ is its fundamental group.

Conversely, every connected covering of $G/H$ is given by a quotient $\widetilde{G}/K$, where $K$ is an intermediary subgroup $\widetilde{H}_0\subset K\subset\widetilde{H}$.

In the particular case that interests us, writing $D_\alpha$ to mean the line $y=\alpha x$, and $\xi$ to mean the vector $(0,1)$, we have:
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    G &= T^2
  \\\widetilde{G} &= \RR^2
  \\H &= [\alpha]
  \\\widetilde{H} &= D_\alpha + (\ZZ+\alpha\ZZ)\xi.
  \end{aligned}
$$

Connectivity coincides with connectivity by differentiable arcs, and an easy calculation then shows that
$$
  \widetilde{T}_\alpha = \RR
  \qquad\text{and}\qquad
  \pi_1(T_\alpha) = \ZZ^2.
\tag{8}
$$

Some comments: the diffeological universal covering of $T_\alpha$ is thus the projection $\pi_\alpha\colon\RR\to\RR/(\ZZ_\alpha\ZZ)$;
the fibre-type $\ZZ+\alpha\ZZ$ is diffeologically discrete, i.e. the only differentiable maps with values in the fibre are the constants;
finally, the action of $\pi_1(T_\alpha)$ on $\RR$ is given by $(n,m)(x)=x+n+\alpha m$.
The other connected coverings of $T_\alpha$ are of the type
$$
  \RR(k\ZZ+\alpha p\ZZ)
  \qquad\text{or}\qquad
  (k,p)\in\ZZ^2.
\tag{4}
$$

The number of sheets, when $k.p\neq0$, is equal to $k.p$.
