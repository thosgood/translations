# Introduction {.unnumbered #introduction}

By Hodge, the cohomology space $\HH^n(X,\CC)$ of a compact Kähler variety $X$ is endowed with a "Hodge structure" of weight $n$, i.e. a natural bigrading
$$
  \HH^n(X,\CC)
  = \bigoplus_{p+q=n} \HH^{p,q}
$$
that satisfies $\overline{\HH^{p,q}}=\HH^{q,p}$.
We will show here that the complex cohomology of a non-singular, not necessarily compact, algebraic variety is endowed with a structure of a slightly more general type, which presents $\HH^n(X,\CC)$ as a "successive extension" of Hodge structures of decreasing weights, contained between $2n$ and $n$, whose Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}=\dim\HH^{p,q}$, are zero for both $p>n$ and $q>n$.

The reader will find an explanation in [@14] of the yoga that underlies this construction.

\oldpage{6}
The proof, which is essentially algebraic, relies on one hand on Hodge theory, and on the other on Hironaka's resolution of singularities, which allows us, via a spectral sequence, "to express" the cohomology of a non-singular quasi-projective algebraic variety in terms of the cohomology of non-singular projective varieties.

[Section 1](#section-1) contains, apart from reminders on filtrations gathered together for the ease of the reader, two key results:

a) [Theorem 1.2.10](#theorem-1.2.10), which will only be used via its corollary, [Theorem 2.3.5](#theorem-2.3.5), which gives the fundamental properties of "mixed Hodge structures".
b) The "two filtrations lemma", [Lemma 1.3.16](#lemma-1.3.16).

[Section 2](#section-2) recalls Hodge theory and introduces mixed Hodge structures.

The heart of this work is [§3.2](#subsection-3.2), which defines the mixed Hodge structure of $\HH^n(X,\CC)$, and establishes some degenerations of spectral sequences.

[Section 4](#section-4) gives diverse applications, all following from [Theorem 4.1.1](#theorem-4.1.1) and the theory of the $(K/k)$-trace, for the resulting Hodge structures ([Corollary 4.1.2](#corollary-4.1.2)).
The principal ones are [Theorem 4.2.6](#theorem-4.2.6) and [Corollary 4.4.15](#corollary-4.4.15).


# Filtrations {#section-1}

::: {.rmenv #chunk-1.1.1 title="1.1.1" latex="{1.1.1}"}
Let $\scr{A}$ be an abelian category.
:::

We will be considering $\ZZ$-filtrations, finite, in general, on the objects of $\scr{A}$:

::: {.rmenv #definition-1.1.2 title="1.1.2" latex="{1.1.2}"}
A *decreasing* (resp. *increasing*) *filtration* $F$ of an object $A$ of $\scr{A}$ is a family $(F^n(A))_{n\in\ZZ}$ (resp. $(F_n(A))_{n\in\ZZ}$) of sub-objects of $A$ satisfying
$$
  \forall n,m
  \quad n\leq m \implies F^m(A)\subset F^n(A)
$$
(resp. $n\leq m\implies F_n(A)\subset F_m(A)$).

A *filtered object* is an object endowed with a filtration.
When there is no chance of confusion, we often denote by the same letter filtrations on different objects of $\scr{A}$.

If $F$ is a decreasing (resp. increasing) filtration on $A$, then we set $F^\infty(A)=0$ and $F^{-\infty}(A)=A$ (resp. $F_{-\infty}(A)=0$ and $F_\infty(A)=A$).

The *shifted filtrations* of a decreasing filtration $W$ are defined by
$$
  W[n]^p(A)
  = W^{n+p}(A)
$$
for $n\in\ZZ$.
