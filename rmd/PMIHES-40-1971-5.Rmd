# Introduction {.unnumbered #introduction}

By Hodge, the cohomology space $\HH^n(X,\CC)$ of a compact Kähler variety $X$ is endowed with a "Hodge structure" of weight $n$, i.e. a natural bigrading
$$
  \HH^n(X,\CC)
  = \bigoplus_{p+q=n} \HH^{p,q}
$$
that satisfies $\overline{\HH^{p,q}}=\HH^{q,p}$.
We will show here that the complex cohomology of a non-singular, not necessarily compact, algebraic variety is endowed with a structure of a slightly more general type, which presents $\HH^n(X,\CC)$ as a "successive extension" of Hodge structures of decreasing weights, contained between $2n$ and $n$, whose Hodge numbers $h^{p,q}=\dim\HH^{p,q}$, are zero for both $p>n$ and $q>n$.

The reader will find an explanation in [@14] of the yoga that underlies this construction.

\oldpage{6}
The proof, which is essentially algebraic, relies on one hand on Hodge theory, and on the other on Hironaka's resolution of singularities, which allows us, via a spectral sequence, "to express" the cohomology of a non-singular quasi-projective algebraic variety in terms of the cohomology of non-singular projective varieties.

[Section 1](#section-1) contains, apart from reminders on filtrations gathered together for the ease of the reader, two key results:

a) [Theorem 1.2.10](#theorem-1.2.10), which will only be used via its corollary, [Theorem 2.3.5](#theorem-2.3.5), which gives the fundamental properties of "mixed Hodge structures".
b) The "two filtrations lemma", [Lemma 1.3.16](#lemma-1.3.16).

[Section 2](#section-2) recalls Hodge theory and introduces mixed Hodge structures.

The heart of this work is [§3.2](#subsection-3.2), which defines the mixed Hodge structure of $\HH^n(X,\CC)$, and establishes some degenerations of spectral sequences.

[Section 4](#section-4) gives diverse applications, all following from [Theorem 4.1.1](#theorem-4.1.1) and the theory of the $(K/k)$-trace, for the resulting Hodge structures ([Corollary 4.1.2](#corollary-4.1.2)).
The principal ones are [Theorem 4.2.6](#theorem-4.2.6) and [Corollary 4.4.15](#corollary-4.4.15).


# Filtrations {#section-1}

## Filtered objects {#section-1.1}

::: {.rmenv #chunk-1.1.1 title="1.1.1" latex="{1.1.1}"}
Let $\scr{A}$ be an abelian category.
:::

We will be considering $\ZZ$-filtrations, finite, in general, on the objects of $\scr{A}$:

::: {.rmenv #definition-1.1.2 title="1.1.2" latex="{1.1.2}"}
A *decreasing* (resp. *increasing*) *filtration* $F$ of an object $A$ of $\scr{A}$ is a family $(F^n(A))_{n\in\ZZ}$ (resp. $(F_n(A))_{n\in\ZZ}$) of sub-objects of $A$ satisfying
$$
  \forall n,m
  \quad n\leq m \implies F^m(A)\subset F^n(A)
$$
(resp. $n\leq m\implies F_n(A)\subset F_m(A)$).

A *filtered object* is an object endowed with a filtration.
When there is no chance of confusion, we often denote by the same letter filtrations on different objects of $\scr{A}$.

If $F$ is a decreasing (resp. increasing) filtration on $A$, then we set $F^\infty(A)=0$ and $F^{-\infty}(A)=A$ (resp. $F_{-\infty}(A)=0$ and $F_\infty(A)=A$).

The *shifted filtrations* of a decreasing filtration $W$ are defined by
$$
  W[n]^p(A)
  = W^{n+p}(A)
$$
for $n\in\ZZ$.
:::

::: {.rmenv #chunk-1.1.3 title="1.1.3" latex="{1.1.3}"}
If $R$ is a decreasing (resp. increasing) filtration of $A$, then the $F_n(A)=F^{-n}(A)$ (resp the $F^n(A)=F_{-n}(A)$) form an increasing (resp. decreasing) filtration of $A$.
\oldpage{7}
This allows us in principal to consider only decreasing filtrations;
*unless otherwise explicitly mentioned, when we say "filtration" we always mean "decreasing filtration"*.
:::

::: {.rmenv #chunk-1.1.4 title="1.1.4" latex="{1.1.4}"}
A filtration $F$ of $A$ is said to be *finite* if there exist $n$ and $m$ such that $F^n(A)=A$ and $F^m(A)=0$.
:::

::: {.rmenv #chunk-1.1.5 title="1.1.5" latex="{1.1.5}"}
A *morphism* from a filtered object $(A,F)$ to a filtered object $(B,F)$ is a morphism $f$ from $A$ to $B$ that satisfies $f(F^n(A))\subset F^n(B)$ for all $n\in\ZZ$.

Filtered objects (resp. finite filtered objects) of $\scr{A}$ form an additive category in which inductive limits and finite projective limits exist (and thus kernels, cokernels, images, and coimages of a morphism).

A morphism $f\colon(A,F)\to(B,F)$ is said to be *strict*, or *strictly compatible with the filtrations*, if the canonical arrows from $\Coim(f)$ to $\Im(f)$ is an isomorphism of filtered objects (cf. [(1.1.11)](#proposition-1.1.11)).
:::

::: {.rmenv #chunk-1.1.6 title="1.1.6" latex="{1.1.6}"}
Let $(-)^\op$ be the contravariant identity functor from $\scr{A}$ to the dual category $\scr{A}^\op$.
If $(A,F)$ is a filtered object of $\scr{A}$, then the $(A/F^n(A))^\op$ can be identified with sub-objects of $A^\op$.
The *dual* filtration on $A^\op$ is defined by
$$
  F^n(A^\op)
  = (A/F^{1-n})^\op.
$$

The double dual of $(A,F)$ can be identified with $(A,F)$.
This construction identifies the dual of the category of filtered objects of $\scr{A}$ with the category of filtered objects of $\scr{A}^\op$.
:::

::: {.rmenv #chunk-1.1.7 title="1.1.7" latex="{1.1.7}"}
If $(A,F)$ is a filtered object of $\scr{A}$, then its *associated graded* is the object of $\scr{A}^\ZZ$ defined by
$$
  \Gr^n(A)
  = F^n(A)/F^{n+1}(A).
$$
The convention [(1.1.6)](#chunk-1.1.6) is justified by the simple formula
$$
  \Gr^n(A^\op)
  = \Gr^{-n}(A)^\op
$$
which follows from the self-dual diagram
**!!TO-DO: diagram (1.1.7.1)!!**
:::

::: {.rmenv #chunk-1.1.8 title="1.1.8" latex="{1.1.8}"}
Let $(A,F)$ be a filtered object, and $j\colon X\hookrightarrow A$ a sub-object of $A$.
The *filtration induced by $F$* (or simply *induced filtration*) on $X$ is the unique filtration on $X$ such that $j$ is strictly compatible with the filtrations;
we have
$$
  F^n(X)
  = j^{-1}(F^n(A))
  = X\cap F^n(A).
$$

Dually, the *quotient filtration* on $A/X$ (the unique filtration such that $p\colon A\to A/X$ is strictly compatible with the filtrations) is given by
$$
  F^n(A/X)
  = p(F^n(A))
  \cong (X+F^n(A))/X
  \cong F^n(A)/(X\cap F^n(A)).
$$
:::

\oldpage{8}

::: {.itenv #lemma-1.1.9 title="Lemma 1.1.9" latex="{Lemma 1.1.9}"}
If $X$ and $Y$ are sub-objects of $A$, with $X\subset Y$, then on $Y/X\simto\Ker(A/X\to A/Y)$ the quotient filtration of $Y$ agrees with that induced by that of $A/X$.
In the diagram
**!!TO-DO: diagram!!**
the arrows are strict.
:::

::: {.rmenv #chunk-1.1.10 title="1.1.10" latex="{1.1.10}"}
We call the filtration [(1.1.9)](#lemma-1.1.9) on $Y/X$ the *filtration induced by that of $A$* (or simply the *induced filtration*).
By [(1.1.9)](#lemma-1.1.9), its definition is self-dual.

In particular, if $\Sigma\colon A\xrightarrow{f}B\xrightarrow{G}C$ is a **!!TO-DO: o-suite?!!** sequence, and if $B$ is filtered, then $\HH(\Sigma)=\Ker(g)/\Im(f)=\Ker(\Coker(f)\to\Coim(g))$ is endowed with a canonical induced filtration.
:::

The reader can show that:

::: {.itenv #proposition-1.1.11 title="Proposition 1.1.11" latex="{Proposition 1.1.11}"}
i. Let $f\colon(A,F)\to(B,F)$ be a morphism of filtered objects with finite filtrations.
    For $f$ to be strict, it is necessary and sufficient that the sequence
    $$
      0
      \to \Gr(\Ker(f))
      \to \Gr(A)
      \to \Gr(B)
      \to \Gr(\Coker(f))
      \to 0
    $$
    be exact.

ii. Let $\sigma\colon(A,F)\to(B,F)\to(C,F)$ be a **!!TO-DO: o-suite?!!** sequence of strict morphisms.
We then have
$$
  \HH(\Gr(\Sigma))
  \cong \Gr(\HH(\Sigma))
$$
canonically.
In particular, if $\Sigma$ is exact in $\scr{A}$, then $\Gr(\Sigma)$ is exact in $\scr{A}^\ZZ$.
:::

In a category of modules, to say that a morphism $f\colon(A,F)\to(B,F)$ is strict implies that every $b\in B$ of filtration $\geq n$ (i.e. $b\in F^n(B)$) that is in the image of $A$ is already in the image of $F^n(A)$:
$$
  f(F^n(A))
  = f(A)\cap F^n(B).
$$

::: {.rmenv #chunk-1.1.12 title="1.1.12" latex="{1.1.12}"}
If $\otimes\colon\scr{A}_1\times\ldots\times\scr{A}_n\to\scr{B}$ is a multiadditive right-exact functor, and if $A_i$ is an object of finite filtration of $\scr{A}_i$ (for $1\leq i\leq n$), then we define a filtration on $\bigotimes_{i=1}^n A_i$ by
$$
  F^k(\bigotimes_{i=1}^n A_i)
  = \sum_{\sum k_i=k} \Im(\bigotimes_{i=1}^n F^{k_i}(A_i)\to\bigotimes_{i=1}^n A_i)
$$
(a sum of sub-objects).

Dually, if $H$ is left-exact, then we set
$$
  F^k(H(A_i))
  = \bigcap_{\sum k_i=k} \Ker(H(A_i)\to H(A_i/F^{k_i}(A_i))).
$$

\oldpage{9}
If $H$ is exact, then the two definitions are equivalent.

We extend these definitions to contravariant functors in certain variables by [(1.1.6)](#chunk-1.1.6).
In particular, for the left-exact functor $\Hom$, we set
$$
  F^k(\Hom(A,B))
  = \{f\colon A\to B \mid f(F^n(A))\subset F^{n+k}(B)\,\,\forall n\}.
$$
We thus have
$$
  \Hom((A,F),(B,F))
  = F^0(\Hom(A,B)).
$$

Under the above hypotheses, we have obvious morphisms
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \bigotimes_{i=1}^n \Gr(A_i)
    &\to \Gr(\bigotimes_{i=1}^n A_i)
  \\\Gr H(A_i)
    &\to H(\Gr(A_i)).
  \end{aligned}
$$
If $H$ is exact, then these are isomorphisms and inverse to one another.

These constructions are compatible with composition of functors, in a sense whose details we leave to the reader.
