# Introduction {-}

\oldpage{137}

In this appendix, we will develop an axiomatic theory of Chern classes that will allow us, in particular, to define the Chern classes of an algebraic vector bundle $E$ on a non-singular quasi-projective algebraic variety $X$ as elements of the Chow ring $A(X)$ of $X$, i.e. as classes of cycles under rational equivalence.
This exposé is inspired one one hand by the book of Hirzebruch (where the essential _formal properties_ characterising a theory of Chern classes were brought to light), and on the other hand by an idea of Chern [@2] that consists of using the multiplicative structure of the ring of cycle classes on the bundle of projective spaces $\mathbb{P}(E)$ associated to $E$, to give an effective _construction_ of Chern classes.
We note that the exposition given here also applies to other settings than algebraic geometry, and recovers, for example, an entirely elementary theory of Chern classes for complex vector bundles on topological manifolds (and, from this, on any space for which the classification theorem of principal bundles with a structure group via a "classifying space" holds true).
Similarly, we will obtain, for a complex-analytic vector bundle $E$ on a (non-singular) complex-analytic manifold $X$, Chern classes
$$
  c_p(E) \in \HH^p(X,\Omega_X^p),
$$
where $\Omega_X^p$ is the sheaf of germs of holomorphic differential forms of degree $p$ on $X$.
[And it is certainly easy to prove that this definition agrees with the one given recently by Atiyah [@1], and that it is related to the topological definition of Chern classes via the spectral sequence relating $\HH^p(X,\Omega_X^q)$ and $\HH^\bullet(X,\mathbb{C})$.]
Similarly, the theory of Stiefel--Whitney classes in $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ cohomology fits into the framework that we will describe here.

\oldpage{138}

It appears that a satisfying theory of Chern classes in algebraic geometry was given, for the first time, by W.L. Chow (unpublished), using the Grassmannian.
The main aim of the current paper has been to eliminate the Grassmannian from the theory.
I have already shown [@4] how the theory of Chern classes allows us to _recover_ the structure of $A(X)$ when $X$ is a Grassmannian.


# Notation {#section-1}

In order to not expose ourselves to the complications arising from intersection theory, we will limit ourselves in what follows to considering only _non-singular_ topological spaces.
We fix, once and for all, a base field $k$.
To better understand the ideas, the reader can assume that $k$ is algebraically closed.
All the bundles, subvarieties, morphisms, etc. that we consider in what follows will be defined over $k$.

If $X$ is an algebraic space, and $E$ a vector bundle on $X$, then we denote by $\mathbb{P}(E)$ the associated projective bundle.
The fibre $\mathbb{P}(E)_x$ of $\mathbb{P}(E)$ at a point $x\in X$ is thus the projective space associated to the vector space $E_x$, and so a point of $\mathbb{P}(E)_x$ over a point $x\in X$ is exactly a homogeneous line in $E_x$.
Let $f\colon\mathbb{P}(E)\to X$ be the projection of the bundle;
we will consider the inverse image of $E$ under $f$, which is the vector bundle $f^{-1}(E)$ on $\mathbb{P}(E)$.
There is a canonical rank-$1$ sub-bundle of $f^{-1}(E)$, whose fibre at a point $d$ of $\mathbb{P}(E)$ (over a point $x\in X$) is the line $d$ in $E_x=f^{-1}(E)_d$.
The dual bundle of this sub-bundle of $f^{-1}(E)$ is denoted by $L_E$, and we thus have the inclusion
$$
  \check{L}_E \subset f^{-1}(E).
$$

Let $p$ be the rank of $E$ (assumed to be constant, which is always the case if $X$ is connected).
Then $E^{(1)}=f^{-1}(E)/\check{L}_E$ is a vector bundle of rank $p-1$ on $X^{(1)}=\mathbb{P}(E)$, and we can thus construct $X^{(2)}=\mathbb{P}(E^{(1)})$ and the analogous bundle $E^{(2)}=(E^{(1)})^{(1)}$ of rank $p-2$ on $X^{(2)}$.
In this manner, we inductively construct manifolds $X^{(i)}$ and vector bundles $E^{(i)}$ of rank $p-i$ on $X^{(i)}$ (for $1\leq i\leq p$), where $X^{(i)}$ is the bundle $\mathbb{P}(E^{(i-1)})$ on $X^{(i-1)}$.
We define a _flag of length $i$_ in a vector space $V$ to be an increasing sequence $(V_j)_{0\leq j\leq i}$ of vector subspaces $V_j$, with $\dim V_j=j$.
Then $X^{(i)}$ can also be understood as the _bundle on $X$ of flags of length $i$_ in $E$, and, if $f^{(i)}$ is the projection from $X^{(i)}$ to $X$, then we directly define, as in the definition of $L_E$, an increasing sequence of sub-bundles $(V_j)_{0\leq j\leq i}$ of $E_i=(f^{(i)})^{(-1)}(E)$, with $\rank(V_j)=j$, with the quotient of $E_i$ by $V_i$ being exactly the vector bundle $E^{(i)}$.
In particular, $X^{(p)}$ is the _flag manifold_ $D(E)$ (of maximum length $p$) of $E$, which resembles a "multiple extension" of $X$ by fibrations in projective spaces associated to vector bundles;
the inverse image $E_p$ of $E$ in $X^{(p)}=D(E)$ is further _completely split_.
By this, we mean that this rank-$p$ vector bundle is endowed with a sequence $(V_i)_{0\leq i\leq p}$ of vector sub-bundles,
with $\rank(V_i)=i$.
Then the $V_i/V_{i-1}$ ($1\leq i\leq p$) are vector bundles of rank $1$, and are called the _factors_ of the given splitting.

\oldpage{139}

If $X$ is an algebraic space, then we denote by $\PP(X)$ the group of isomorphism classes of rank-$1$ vector bundles on $X$ (the composition law of the group being given by the tensor product of bundles).
If $L$ is such a rank-$1$ vector bundle, then we denote by $\cl_X(L)$ the element of $\PP(X)$ that it defines.
We thus have
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \cl_X(L\otimes L') &= \cl_X(L) + \cl_X(L')
  \\\cl_X(\check{L}) &= -\cl_X(L).
  \end{aligned}
$$

If $f\colon X\to Y$ is a morphism, then the formula
$$
  f^*(\cl_X(L)) = \cl_X(f^{-1}(L))
$$
defines a homomorphism $f^*$ from $\PP(Y)$ to $\PP(X)$.
In this way, $\PP(X)$ can be considered as a _contravariant functor_ in $X$.

With $f\colon X\to Y$ still a morphism, let $F$ be a rank-$p$ vector bundle on $Y$, and set $E=f^{-1}(F)$.
This is a rank-$p$ vector bundle on $X$, and we have a canonical isomorphism $\mathbb{P}(E)=f^{-1}(\mathbb{P}(F))$, whence a natural morphism
$$
  \bar{f}\colon \mathbb{P}(E) \to \mathbb{P}(F).
$$

With this, we can immediately verify that $L_E$ is canonically isomorphic to the inverse image $\bar{f}^{-1}(L_F)$_.
We thus have the formula
$$
  \cl(L_E) = \bar{f}^*(\cl(L_F)).
$$

Let $E$ be a rank-$p$ vector bundle on $X$, and $s$ a regular section of $E$.
Then $s$ is a morphism from $X$ to $E$, and even an isomorphism from $X$ to a closed subspace of codimension $p$ of $E$.
In particular, the image of $X$ under the zero section is a closed non-singular subspace $X'$ of codimension $p$ of $E$.
Evidently, the inverse image $s^{-1}(X')$ is exactly the set of zeros of $s$.
For the _cycle_ $s^{-1}(X')$ to be well defined, it is necessary and sufficient for the set of zeros of $s$ to be everywhere empty, or of codimension $p$ in $X$.
In this case, we can then speak of the _cycle of zeros_ of the section $s$.
Recall also that the morphism $s$ is said to be _transversal_ to the subvariety $X'$ of $X$ if, at every point of the inverse image of $X'$ under $s$, the tangent map to $s$ is surjective modulo the tangent space to $X'$.
In this case, $s^{-1}(X')$ is a non-singular algebraic subspace of $X$ that is everywhere of codimension $p$, and all of its components are of multiplicity $1$ in the cycle of zeros of $s$.
We will then say, for brevity, that the section $s$ is _transversal to the zero section_.
We can express this property by a calculation:
since it is local on $X$, we can assume that $E$ is the trivial bundle $X\times k^p$, so that $s$ is defined by the data of $p$ regular functions $(f_1,\ldots,f_p)$ on $X$;
for $s$ to be transversal to the zero section, it is necessary and sufficient for the functions $f_1,\ldots,f_p$ to give a regular system of parameters of $\scr{O}_x$ at every point $x$.


# The functor $A(X)$ {#section-2}

\oldpage{140}

In what follows, suppose that we have a category $\cal{V}$ of non-singular algebraic spaces (the morphisms in this category being the morphisms of algebraic spaces).
The only condition that we impose on $\cal{V}$ is the following:

::: {.rmenv #V1 title="V1" data-latex="{V1}"}
If $X\in\cal{V}$, and if $E$ is a vector bundle on $X$, then $\mathbb{P}(E)\in\cal{V}$.
:::

Suppose further that we have the following data:

::: {.rmenv #data-a title="a" data-latex="{a}"}
A contravariant functor $X\mapsto A(X)$ from $\cal{V}$ to the category of unital anticommutative graded rings.
:::

::: {.rmenv #data-b title="b" data-latex="{b}"}
A homomorphism $p_X\colon\PP(X)\to A^2(X)$ that is functorial in $X\in\cal{V}$.
:::

::: {.rmenv #data-c title="c" data-latex="{c}"}
For all $X\in\cal{V}$, and for every closed algebraic subspace $Y$ of $X$, of constant codimension $p$ in $X$, with $Y\in\cal{V}$, a group homomorphism
$$
  i_*\colon A(Y)\to A(X)
$$
(where $i$ denotes the injection $Y\to X$) that raises the degree by $2p$.
:::

If $f\colon X\to Y$ is a morphism in $\cal{V}$, then we denote the corresponding homomorphism from $A(Y)$ to $A(X)$ by $f^*$.
The unit element of $A(X)$ will be denoted by $1_X$, and, if $X\in\cal{V}$, and if $Y$ is a closed algebraic subspace of constant codimension $p$ of $X$, with $Y\in\cal{V}$, then we define $p_X(Y)=i_*(1_Y)$, where $i$ is (again) the injection morphism from $Y$ into $X$.

With this, we suppose that the following conditions are satisfied:

::: {.rmenv #axiom-A1 title="A1" data-latex="{A1}"}
Let $X\in\cal{V}$, and let $E$ be a rank-$p$ vector bundle on $X$, $\mathbb{P}(E)$ the associated projective bundle, and $\xi_E$ the element of $A(\mathbb{P}(E))$ defined by
$$
  \xi_E = p(\cl(L_E)).
$$
We can think of $A(\mathbb{P}(E))$ as a left $A(X)$-module via the homomorphism $f^*\colon A(X)\to A(\mathbb{P}(E))$ associated to the projection $f\colon\mathbb{P}(E)\to X$.
Then the elements
$$
  (\xi_E)^0, \ldots, (\xi_E)^{p-1}
$$
form a basis of $A(\mathbb{P}(E))$ over $A(X)$.
:::

::: {.rmenv #axiom-A2 title="A2" data-latex="{A2}"}
Let $X\in\cal{V}$, and let $L$ be a rank-$1$ vector bundle on $X$, and $s$ a regular section of $L$ that is transversal to the zero section, and such that the space $Y$ of zeros of $s$ belongs to $\cal{V}$.
Then
$$
  p_X(Y) = p_X(\cl_X(L)).
$$
:::

::: {.rmenv #axiom-A3 title="A3" data-latex="{A3}"}
Let $X,Y,Z\in\cal{V}$, with $Z\subset Y\subset X$, and let $i\colon Z\to Y$ and $j\colon Y\to X$ be the injection morphisms.
Then $(ji)_* = j_*i_*$.
:::

::: {.rmenv #axiom-A4 title="A4" data-latex="{A4}"}
Let $X,Y\in\cal{V}$, with $Y\subset X$, and let $i\colon Y\to X$ be the injection morphism.
Then
$$
  i_*(bi^*(a)) = i_*(b)a
$$
for all $a\in A(X)$ and all $b\in A(Y)$,
:::

\oldpage{141}

From these axioms we will prove two lemmas that will be useful in the [next section](#section-3).

::: {.itenv #lemma-1 title="Lemma 1" data-latex="{Lemma 1}"}
Let $X\in\cal{V}$, and let $E$ be a rank-$p$ vector bundle on $X$.
Consider, for all $1\leq i\leq p$, the bundle $X^{(i)}$ of flags of length $i$ in $E$.
Then $X^{(i)}\in\cal{V}$, and the homomorphism $A(X)\to A(X^{(i)})$ induced by the projection $X^{(i)}\to X$ is \emph{injective}.
:::

::: {.proof}
By [§1](#section-1), we can restrict, by induction on $i$, to the case of the projective bundle $X^{(1)}=\mathbb{P}(E)$ associated to $E$.
Then our claims are an immediate consequence of [V1](#V1) and [A1](#A1) [since the element $1_{\mathbb{P}(E)}=(\xi_E)^0$ is free over the ring $A(X)$].
:::

::: {.itenv #lemma-2 title="Lemma 2" data-latex="{Lemma 2}"}
Let $X\in\cal{V}$, and let $E$ be a rank-$p$ vector bundle on $X$, with $s$ a regular section of $E$, and $(E_i)_{0\leq i\leq p}$ a decreasing sequence of vector sub-bundles of $E$, with $\rank E_i=p-i$.
Define, for $1\leq i\leq p$,
$$
  \xi_i = p_X\cl_X(E_{i-1}/E_i)
$$
For every $1\leq i\leq p$, let $Y_i$ be the subset of $X$ consisting of those $x\in X$ such that $s(x)\in E_i$.
Suppose that, for all $i$, $Y_i$ is a non-singular subvariety of $X$, and that $Y_i\in\cal{V}$.
Let $s_i$ be the section of $(E_i/E_{i+1})|Y_i$ defined by $s$, and suppose that, for $1\leq i\leq p-1$, $s_i$ is transversal to the zero section.
Then, under these conditions,
$$
  p_X(Y_p) = \prod_{1\leq i\leq p}\xi_i.
$$
:::

::: {.proof}
We will prove, by induction on $j$ (where $1\leq j\leq p$), that
$$
  p_X(Y_j) = \prod_{1\leq i\leq j}\xi_i.
\tag{$\star$}
$$

For $j=1$, this equation is exactly axiom [A2](#axiom-A2).
Now suppose that the equation has been proven for some $j<p$;
we will prove it for $j+1$.
Applying [A2](#axiom-A2) to the section $s_j$ of $(E_j/E_{j+1})|Y_j$, we see that
$$
  p_{Y_j}(Y_{j+1}) = p_{Y_j}\cl_{Y_j}((E_j/E_{j+1})|Y_j).
$$
Let $u_j$ be the injection morphism $Y_j\to X$.
From the functoriality of $\cl$ and $p$ we see that the right-hand side of the above equation is $u_j^*(p_X\cl_X(E_j/E_{j+1}))$, whence
$$
  p_{Y_j}(Y_{j+1}) = u_j^*(\xi_{j+1}).
$$
Using axiom [A3](#axiom-A3), we thus conclude that
$$
  p_X(Y_{j+1}) = (u_j)_*(u_j^*(\xi_{j+1})).
$$
The right-hand side of this equation can also be written as $(u_j)_*(1_{y_j}u_j^*(\xi_{j+1}))$, which is equal, by axiom [A4](#axiom-A4), to $(u_j)_*(1_{Y_j})\xi_{j+1} = p_X(Y_j)\xi_{j+1}$.
Using the induction hypothesis, we then indeed recover the analogous formula, with $j+1$ instead of $j$.
:::

\oldpage{142}

The following corollary will only be used in [§3](#section-3).

::: {.itenv #lemma-2-corollary title="Corollary" data-latex="{Corollary}"}
Under the conditions of [Lemma 2](#lemma-2), if, further, $s$ is non-zero at every point, then $\prod_{1\leq i\leq p}\xi_i=0$.
:::

::: {.rmenv title="Remark" data-latex="{Remark}"}
The introduction of the operation $i$ in [c.](#data-c), and the axioms [A2](#axiom-A2), [A3](#axiom-A3), and [A4](#axiom-A4) concerning this operation, only serve to provide us with technical means of being able to prove [the corollary to Lemma 2](#lemma-2-corollary).
(Axiom [A4](#axiom-A4) would still have sufficed even if we had assumed that $b=1_Y$.)
For the theory of Chern classes in [the following section](#section-3), we will only need the data of [a.](#data-a) and [b.](#data-b), axiom [A2](#axiom-A1), and [the corollary to Lemma 2](#lemma-2-corollary).
:::

::: {.rmenv title="Particular cases" data-latex="{Particular cases}"}
We note, first of all, that condition [V1](#V1) is satisfied for all reasonable categories of algebraic spaces;
it is satisfied, in particular, for the categories of arbitrary non-singular algebraic spaces, of non-singular quasi-projective algebraic spaces, and of non-singular projective algebraic spaces.
The verification for the two latter cases presents no difficulty, and is left to the reader (the result being a particular case of a more general result concerning blown-up varieties).

We now given some particular cases where the conditions in this section are satisfied.

1. $\cal{V}$ is the category of non-singular quasi-projective algebraic spaces, and $A(X)$ is the ring of cycle classes on $X$ under _rational equivalence_, with the usual definition of $f^*$ and $f_*$.
    Of course, we grade $A(X)$ by taking the class of a cycle on $X$ that is everywhere of codimension $p$ to be of degree $2p$ [so that $A(X)$ has only even degrees, as we would expect in a cohomological theory for a _commutative_ graded ring].
    The homomorphism $\PP(X)\to A^2(X)$ is an isomorphism, given by sending any rank-$1$ vector bundle $L$ on $X$ to the set of divisors of rational sections of $L$ that are not zero on any component of $X$.
    For the theory of linear equivalence, including the verification of [A1](#axiom-A1) to [A4](#axiom-A4) (with only [A1](#axiom-A1) not being immediate), see the exposés by Chevalley and Grothendieck in [@4].

    The conditions that we demand are also satisfied if we take $A(X)$ to be the ring of cycle classes under _algebraic_ equivalence, but, for a theory of Chern classes, we rather prefer to work with rational equivalence, which gives a finer theory.

    We cannot yet define a ring structure on the group $A(X)$ of cycle classes on an _arbitrary_ (not necessarily quasi-projective) non-singular variety, nor, for a morphism $f\colon X\to Y$, a morphism $f^*\colon A(Y)\to A(X)$ in such a way that the necessary conditions are satisfied.
    Further, it is not even certain that this might be possible.
    We can imagine replacing the ring of cycle classes (under rational equivalence) by the graded ring associated to the ring $K(X)$ of classes of coherent algebraic sheaves on $X$, filtered in the natural way (by considering the dimension of the supports of the sheaves).
    Unfortunately, we would then have to prove that this filtration is compatible with the ring structure (and with the "inverse image" homomorphisms), which I only know how to do in the quasi-projective case, by using rational equivalence.
    However, it seems that these difficulties disappear when we tensor with the field of rationals $\mathbb{Q}$, i.e. if we ignore the phenomenons of torsion.

\oldpage{143}

2. $\cal{V}$ is the category of all non-singular algebraic spaces.
    If $X$ is such a variety, then we denote by $\Omega_X^\bullet$ the sheaf of germs of regular differential forms on $X$, and by $A(X)$ the cohomology group $\HH^\bullet(X,\Omega_X^\bullet)$.
    We grade this group by taking $\HH^p(X,\Omega_X^q)$ to be of degree $p+q$, and we make this an algebra by means of the cup product.
    We thus obtain an anticommutative graded algebra, which is clearly a contravariant functor with respect to $X$.
    By following the formalism developed by Grothendieck in [@3], we define in a natural way the homomorphism $i_*\colon A(Y)\to A(X)$ associated to an injection $i\colon Y\to X$ (and it is probably possible to define $i_*$ for every _proper_ morphism $i\colon Y\to X$).^[(Note added during editing). This homomorphism $i_*$ is now defined in full generality.]
    Finally, we define a morphism $\PP(X)\to\HH^1(X,\Omega_X^1)\subset A^2(X)$ in a classical way, by writing, for example, $\PP(X)=\HH^1(X,\scr{O}_X^\times)$ (where $\scr{O}_X^\times$ denotes the sheaf of germs of invertible regular functions on $X$), and by considering the homomorphism $f\mapsto\mathrm{d}f/f$ from $\scr{O}_X^\times$ to $\Omega_X^1$.
    We can again easily verify that conditions [A1](#axiom-A1) to [A4](#axiom-A4) are satisfied, with [A1](#axiom-A1) being a consequence of the Leray spectral sequence of the continuous map $\mathbb{P}(E)\to X$ [the spectral sequence being trivial, as follows from considering from the class $\xi_E$ on $\mathbb{P}(E)$.]

3. The base field $k$ is the field of complex numbers, $\cal{V}$ is the category of non-singular algebraic spaces, and $A(X)=\HH^\bullet(X,\mathbb{Z})$ (with $X$ being endowed with its "usual" topology).
    The definition of [b.](#data-b) (either by Poincaré duality on divisor classes, or as an obstruction class in the classical exact sequence $0\to\mathbb{Z}\to\scr{O}_X\to\scr{O}_X^\times\to0$ of sheaves on $X$, endowed with its usual topology) is well known.
    The definition of [c.](#data-c) classically comes
    from Poincaré duality, and properties [A1](#axiom-A1) to [A4](#axiom-A4) are well known (with [A1](#axiom-A1) again following from the Leray spectral sequence).

# Definition and fundamental properties of Chern classes {#section-3}

Let $X\in\cal{V}$, and let $E$ be a rank-$p$ vector bundle on $X$, and $\xi_E=p_X(\cl(L_E))$ the fundamental class in $A^2(\mathbb{P}(E))$.
By axiom [A1](#axiom-A1) from the previous section, $(\xi_E)^p$ can be written as a unique linear combination of the $(\xi_E)^i$ (for $0\leq i\leq p-1$) with coefficients in $A(X)$.
This means that we can find, in a unique way, elements $c_i(E)\in A^{2i}(X)$ (defined for every integer $i\geq0$) satisfying the conditions
$$
  \begin{gathered}
    \sum_{i=0}^p c_i(E)(\xi_E)^{p-i} = 0,
  \\c_0(E)=1, \quad\text{and}\quad c_i(E)=0\text{ for }i>p.
  \end{gathered}
\tag{1}
$$
The $c_i(E)$ are called the _Chern classes_ of $E$, with $c_i(E)$ being called the $i$th Chern class.
We define
$$
  c(E) = \sum_i c_i(E)
\tag{2}
$$
and call $c(E)$ the _(total) Chern class_ of $E$;
its data is equivalent to the data of all the $c_i(E)$.

::: {.itenv #theorem-1 title="Theorem 1" data-latex="{Theorem 1}"}
Suppose that we have the data of [a.](#data-a), [b.](#data-b), and [c.](#data-c) from the previous section, satisfying axioms [A1](#axiom-A1) to [A4](#axiom-A4).
Then the Chern classes (defined by (1)) satisfy the following conditions:

i. _Functoriality._ ---
    Let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a morphism in $\cal{V}$, and let $E$ be a vector bundle on $Y$.
    Then
    $$
      c(f^{-1}(E)) = f^*(c(E))
    \tag{3}
    $$
    [where $f^{-1}(E)$ denotes the vector bundle on $X$ given by the inverse image of $E$ under $f$].

ii. _Normalisation._ ---
    If $E$ is a rank-$1$ vector bundle on $X\in\cal{V}$, then
    $$
      c(E) = 1+p_X(\cl_X(E)).
    \tag{4}
    $$

iii. _Additivity._ ---
    Let $X\in\cal{V}$, and let $0\to E'\to E\to E''\to 0$ be an exact sequence of vector bundles on $X$.
    Then
    $$
      c(E) = c(E')c(E'').
    \tag{5}
    $$

Furthermore, properties i., ii., and iii. entirely _characterise_ Chern classes.
:::

\oldpage{145}

::: {.proof}
We first prove the _uniqueness_ of a theory of Chern classes satisfying properties i., ii., and iii.
Let $X\in\cal{V}$, and let $E$ be a rank-$p$ vector bundle on $X$, and $X'$ the flag variety associated to $E$, with $f'\colon X\to X$ the canonical projection.
By [Lemma 1](#lemma-1), we know that $X'\in\cal{V}$, and that $f^*\colon A(X)\to A(X')$ is injective.
So, if we know $c(E)$, then we know $f(c(E))$;
the latter, by i., is equal to $c(f^{-1}(E))$.
But $f^{-1}(E)$ splits completely.
We can thus reduce to determining $c(E)$ when $E$ is a rank-$p$ vector bundle that splits completely, and which is thus endowed with a composition series $(E_i)_{0\leq i\leq p}$, with $\rank E_i=p-i$,
But then the additivity formula iii. proves (by induction on $p$) that $c(E)=\prod_{i=1}^p c(E_{i-1}/E_i)$.
Finally, the normalisation formula ii. implies that
$$
  c(E) = \prod_{i=1}^p (1+p_X\cl_X(E_{i-1}/E_i)).
\tag{6}
$$

We now show that the Chern classes defined by (1) do indeed satisfy i., ii., and iii.

_(Proof of i.)_
Let $X,Y\in\cal{V}$, and let $E$ be a vector bundle on $Y$, and $F$ its inverse image under $f$.
Then $\mathbb{P}(F)$ is the inverse image of $\mathbb{P}(E)$ under $f$, and so we have a commutative diagram of morphisms
$$
  \begin{CD}
    \mathbb{P}(F) @>\bar{f}>> \mathbb{P}(E)
  \\@VpVV @VVqV
  \\X @>>f> Y
  \end{CD}
$$
