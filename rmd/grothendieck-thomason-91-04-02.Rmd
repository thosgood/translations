*Les Aumettes, 2nd of April 1991.*

Dear Thomason,

Thank you for your letter, and forgive me for having taken so much time to reply.
One reason for this is that, since for the past maybe two months I have been busy thinking about something that started as a small diversion, which I thought I would be able to sort out in a few days (a familiar sentence...), and I delayed this letter week after week.
