*Les Aumettes, 2nd of April 1991.*

Dear Thomason,

Thank you for your letter, and forgive me for having taken so much time to reply.
One reason for this is that, since for the past maybe two months I have been busy thinking about something that started as a small diversion, which I thought I would be able to sort out in a few days (a familiar sentence...), and I delayed this letter week after week.
This thought is not really about homotopical algebra per se, but more about the foundations of category theory, and I have done a lot more than what I need right now [@9, Chapter XVIII].
But up until now, I have been convinced that a homotopical algebra (or, in a more vast vision, a "topological algebra") such as I envisage cannot be developed with all the breadth that it has without the aforementioned categorical foundations.
It concerns a theory of (large) categories that I have been calling "*accessible*", and accessible subsets of these, completely rewriting the provisional theory that I present in SGA 4, §I.9 [@2].
I have woven a tapestry of nearly two hundred pages on this seemingly trivial theme, and it would please me to present to you the outlines, if that would be of interest to you.
There are also some intriguing problems that remain, that I feel are difficult, maybe even deep, and that could maybe (who knows) inspire you, or somebody else interested in the foundations of the tool that is category theory.
But all this seems to me part of the domain of the tool, and I would prefer, in this letter, to speak about more central things.
The main ideas were, for the most part, born over 25 years ago, and I see the enduring seedlings of them in my solitary reflections from the years '56 and '57, when I first had the need of categories of "coefficients" that were less prohibitively large than the interminable complexes of chains or of cochains, and the idea (after long periods of perplexity) of constructing such categories via passing to a category of fractions (a notion that had to be invented by considering concrete elements) by "inverting" the quasi-isomorphisms.
The principal conceptual work that remained to be done --- and that now seems to me as equally fascinating (as much as for its beauty as for its evident impact on the foundations of a cohomological algebra in the spirit of a theory of cohomological coefficients) as in the times of my first loves with cohomology --- was to clarify the intrinsic structure of these categories.
The fact that this work, that I had confided to Verdier around 1960, and that was meant to be the subject of his thesis [@13], had still not yet been done, even in the case of ordinary and abelian derived categories, ...........
