*Les Aumettes, 2nd of April 1991.*

Dear Thomason,

Thank you for your letter, and forgive me for having taken so much time to reply.
One reason for this is that, since for the past maybe two months I have been busy thinking about something that started as a small diversion, which I thought I would be able to sort out in a few days (a familiar sentence...), and I delayed this letter week after week.
This thought is not really about homotopical algebra per se, but more about the fundamentals of category theory, and I have done a lot more than what I need right now [@9, Chapter XVIII].
But up until now, I have been convinced that a homotopical algebra (or, in a more vast vision, a "topological algebra") such as I envisage cannot be developed with all the breadth that it has without the aforementioned categorical foundations.
