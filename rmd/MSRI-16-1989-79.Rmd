# Introduction {-}

\oldpage{3 (81)}
The present article owes much to A. Grothendieck.
He invented the philosophy of motives, which is our guiding thread.
Around five years ago, he also said to me, with conviction, that the profinite completion $\hat{\pi}_1$ of the fundamental group of $X\coloneqq\PP^1(\CC)\setminus\{0,1,\infty\}$, with the action of $\Gal(\bar{\QQ}/\QQ)$, is a remarkable object, and that it must be studied.

Every finite cover of $X$ can be described by equations with coefficients in the algebraic numbers.
Applying an element of $\Gal(\bar{\QQ}/\QQ)$ to these coefficients, we obtain the equations of another cover.
Understanding how $\Gal(\bar{\QQ}/\QQ)$ permutes the isomorphism classes of finite covers essentially reduces to understanding the Galois action on $\hat{\pi}_1$.
"Essentially", since I have omitted mentioning the base points, and since the Galois covers have not been thought of as $G$-covers, for $G$ their automorphism group.

Up until now, we have not had the language necessary to study the Galois action on $\hat{\pi}_1$.
A. Grothendieck and his students have developed a combinatorial description ("charts") of finite covers of $X$, based on a decomposition of $\PP^1(\CC)$ into the two "spherical triangles" $\Im(z)\geq0$ and $\Im(z)\leq0$, with sides $[\infty,0]$, $[0,1]$, and $[1,\infty]$.
This has not helped in understanding the Galois action.
We have only a few unresolved examples of covers whose Galois conjugates have been calculated.

In this article, we only consider when $\hat{\pi}_1$ is rendered nilpotent, i.e. quotients $\hat{\pi}_1^{(N)}$ of $\hat{\pi}_1$ by the subgroups of its decreasing central series.
The profinite group $\hat{\pi}_1^{(N)}$ is a product over primes $\ell$ of nilpotent pro-$\ell$-groups: $\hat{\pi}_1^{(N)} = \prod_\ell \hat{\pi}_1^{(N)}{}\!_\ell$.
Each $\hat{\pi}_1^{(N)}{}\!_\ell$ is an $\ell$-adic Lie group.
It admits a Lie algebra $\Lie\hat{\pi}_1^{(N)}{}\!_\ell$, which is a Lie algebra over $\QQ_\ell$.
If we choose a base point $x\in X(\QQ)=\QQ\setminus\{0,1\}$, then $\Gal(\bar{\QQ}/\QQ)$ acts on these Lie algebras.
The action, up to inner automorphism, does not depend on the choice of $x$.
We would like to understand these actions.

The nilpotent versions of $\pi_1$ are very close to cohomology.
This is most visible in the theory of D. Sullivan [@Su; @Mo].
_Notation:_ for $\Gamma$ a finitely generated group, let $Z^i\Gamma$ be the decreasing central series, let $\Gamma^{(N)}=\Gamma/Z^{N+1}\Gamma$, and let $\Gamma^{[N]}=\Gamma^{(N)}/\mathrm{torsion}$ [(9.3)](#chunk-9.3).
The theory of Malcev [@Mal] attaches a nilpotent Lie algebra over $\QQ$, denoted $\Lie\Gamma^{[N]}$, to $\Gamma^{[N]}$, such that $\Gamma^{[N]}$ is a congruence subgroup of the unipotent algebraic group over $\QQ$ of the Lie algebra $\Lie\Gamma^{[N]}$.
By D. Sullivan, if $X$ is a differentiable manifold, then $\Lie\pi_1(X)^{[N]}\otimes\RR$ is determined, up to inner automorphism, by the differential-graded algebra $\Omega_X^\bullet$, taken up to quasi-isomorphism.

\oldpage{4 (82)}

This close relation with cohomology hints that the study of nilpotent versions of $\hat{\pi}_1$ is far from the "anabelian" dream of A. Grothendieck.
It allows us, however, to use his philosophy of motives.

Let $k$ be a number field.
If $X$ is an algebraic variety over $k$, then we have a whole series of parallel cohomology theories for $X$: the classical cohomology of $X(\CC)$ (for each complex embedding of $k$), crystalline cohomology (which is equal to de Rham cohomology if $X$ is smooth), $\ell$-adic cohomology, ...
The groups thus obtained are endowed with various additional structures (mixed Hodge, Galois action, ...) and are linked by comparison isomorphism.
In [ยง1](#section-1), we axiomatise the situation by defining "realisation systems over $k$".
The exact definition is not to be taken seriously: considering the applications --- and what we are capable of doing --- it could be wise to either add or remove data as much as axioms.
The essential, for us, is that

i. The category of realisation systems is endowed with a $\otimes$ satisfying the usual properties: it is a Tannakian category over $\QQ$.

ii. Conjecturally, the category of motives is a full subcategory of the category of realisation systems.

Condition (ii) requires, in particular, that, for every variety $X$ over $k$ and for every $i$, the available cohomology theories, applied to $X$, give a realisation system $H^i(X)$ over $k$ (which we will denote by $H^i(X)_\mot$, and call the motivic $H^i$ of $X$).

Analogous ideas have been independently developed by U. Jannsen [@J].
In [@J], U. Jannsen defines (mixed) motives over $k$ as constituting the Tannakian subcategory (of the category of realisation systems) generated by the $H^i(X)$ for $X$ smooth and quasi-projective.
Here we are still being imprecise, saying that a motive over $k$ is a realisation system "of geometric origin".
For $X$ over $k$ and $x\in X(k)$, we want, for example, to regard $\Lie\pi_1(X(\CC),x)^{[N]}$ as a realisation of a motive over $k$.

This article owes much to an unpublished work of Z. Wojtkoviak.
For $X=\PP^1\setminus\{0,1,\infty\}$ and $x\in X(\CC)$, I proposed to him a definition of the mixed Hodge structure of $\Lie\pi_1(X(\CC),x)^{[N]}$.
He calculated it in part, for small $N$, and, to my extreme surprise, show that, for $N=4$, its description involves $\zeta(3)$.
A decanted form of the calculations appear in [ยง19](#section-19).
In fact, the whole article originates from my desire to understand the result of Z. Wojtkoviak.
\oldpage{5 (83)}
I have also been helped by the answer by O. Gabber to my question "How can we construct an extension of $\ZZ_\ell$ by $\ZZ_\ell(3)$, uniformly in $\ell$?": "By a class in $K_5(\QQ)$", as well as by the conjectures of A. Beilinson on the values of $L$-functions.

If $X$ is an algebraic variety over a number field $k$, $x\in X(k)$, and $N$ an integer, then we want to have a realisation system $\Lie\pi_1(X,x)_\mot^{(N)}$.
We can only succeed in constructing this under additional hypotheses on $X$: in the general case, certain realisations are missing.
The case of $\PP^1$ minus some points --- more generally, of smooth rational varieties --- is nonetheless covered.

Let $k=\QQ$, $X=\PP^1\setminus\{0,1,\infty\}$, and $x\in X(\QQ)$.
The associated graded algebra for the weight filtration of $\Lie\pi_1(X,x)_\mot^{(N)}$ is the free Lie algebra on $H_1(X)_\mot$, modulo its $Z^{N+1}$ (decreasing central series).
$H_1(X)_\mot$ is the sum of two copies of the Tate motive $\QQ(1)$.
We thus deduce that $\Lie\pi_1(X,x)_\mot^{(N)}$ is an iterated extension of Tate motives $\QQ(n)$.
The fact that non-trivial extensions appear is what gives it its charm.

I conjecture that, over a number field $k$, the group of motivic extensions of $\QQ$ by $\QQ(n)$ ($n>0$) is $K_{2n-1}(k)\otimes\QQ$.
For a general framework into which we can place this conjecture, see [@B, ยง5].
In particular, for $k=\QQ$, we want $\Ext^1(\QQ,\QQ(n))$ to be zero for $n$ even, and of dimension $1$ for $n\geq3$ odd.
This is the motivic $\Ext^1$: extensions as realisation systems that "come from algebraic geometry".
This conjecture places severe restrictions on $\Lie\pi_1(X,x)_\mot^{(N)}$, which are far from having been verified.
What we know concerns, up to now, only the quotient by the second derived group.
A large part of this article is dedicated to developing a language in which the consequences of the conjecture affecting $\Lie\pi_1(X,x)_\mot^{(N)}$ can be clearly stated.

We now go through this article, pointing out several shortcuts.

In [ยง1](#section-1), we describe the category of realisation systems over a base $S$.
The base $S$ can be: $\Spec(\QQ)$, $\Spec(\FF)$ for $\FF$ a number field, an open subset of the spectrum of the ring of integers of a number field, or smooth over $\Spec(\ZZ)$.
In this category, the $\Hom$ are $\QQ$-vector spaces.
We also define a notion of integer structure;
in the category of realisation systems with integer coefficients (= endowed with an integer structure), the $\Hom$ are free $\ZZ$-modules of finite type.
The definition has a crystalline component.
The reader is invited to ignore this for a first approximation.
The theory coincides with that of U. Jannsen [@J].
\oldpage{6 (84)}
The crystalline aspect will be neglected in the rest of the introduction.

In [ยง2](#section-2) we give examples.
We also explain what an extension of the unit realisation system $\ZZ$ by a realisation system $M$ with integer coefficients is.
_Terminology:_ $M$-torsor, or torsor under $M$.
_Example:_ the Kummer $\ZZ(1)$-torsor, where $\ZZ(1)$ is the Tate motive.

In [ยง3](#section-3) we describe certain remarkable torsors, which can be said to be cyclotomic, under the Tate motive $\ZZ(k)$.
[ยง16](#section-16) explains how these torsors naturally appear in the study of $\pi_1$ of $\PP^1\setminus\{0,1,\infty\}$.
The description here is direct, but unmotivated.
The claim that some of these torsors are of finite order ([(3.5)](#chunk-3.5), [(3.14)](#3.14)) lets us recover the known formulas expressing the Dirichlet $L$-functions in negative integers as integrals of distributions over $\hZZ$ with values in $\hZZ$: a version of Kummer congruences.
In [ยง18](#section-18), we prove [(3.5)](#chunk-3.5) and [(3.14)](#chunk-3.14) using the geometric interpretation of [ยง16](#section-16).
In [ยง3](#section-3), we give a direct proof, by using the known formulas for $L(\chi,1-k)$.

[ยง4](#section-4) is a pot-pourri of reminders on Ind-objects and pro-objects.
The reader is invited to consult this only when needed.

We want to give a motivic meaning to an assertion like the following: the fundamental group of $\PP^1(\CC)\setminus\{0,1,\infty\}$ (at base point $b$) is freely generated by the following loops:

    \draw[thick] (0,-0.125) to (2.69,0.61);
  \end{tikzpicture}
\tag{1}
$$
-->

The purpose of [ยง5](#section-5), [ยง7](#section-7), and [ยง15](#section-15) is to construct the language which allows us to do this.
This consists of

a. giving a motivic meaning to $\pi_1(X,x)^{(N)}$, not only to its Lie algebra;

b. giving a motivic meaning to the torsor [(0.6)](#chunk-0.6) of homotopy classes of paths from $b_1$ to $b_2$;

c. in [(1)](#figure-1), the "monodromy around $0$" loop is only unambiguously determined for $b$ "close to $0$".
    We must define what it means for a base point to be "close to $0$".

\oldpage{7 (85)}

Our solution will be to define a motivic linear group as being an Ind-object in the category of motives, endowed with the structure of a commutative Hopf algebra.
To avoid speculation: consider the group in realisation systems, and replace "motive" by "realisation system".
There is an analogous definition for torsors under a group.
We separately define a notion of "integer" structures.
This definition has the advantage that the standard constructions in algebraic geometry (decreasing central series, quotients, pushing forward a $G$-torsor by $G\to H$, twisting by a torsor, ...) all translate automatically to the motivic case.
This, in an arbitrary Tannakian category, is explained in [ยง5](#section-5).

In [ยง7](#section-7), we reinterpret these definitions in a language that is closer to that of our applications.
The reader who is displeased by the general nonsense of [ยง5](#section-5) and [ยง7](#section-7) can take the interpretations given in [ยง7](#section-7) as the definition of groups, torsors, ... in realisation systems.
Drawback: every standard construction must be redefined in this case.

In the classical definition of $\pi_1$, the role of the base point $b$ can be played by a contractible subset $B$.
It can also be played by a filter $\mathcal{B}$ on $X$ whose base if given by contractible subsets.
For example, if $X$ is a Riemann surface $\overline{X}$ minus a point $s$, and $v$ is a non-zero tangent vector at $s$, with $z$ being a local coordinates centred at $s$, then we can take the contractible subsets

The filter $\mathcal{B}(v)$ that they generate is independent of the chosen coordinate.
By this construction, a non-zero tangent vector at $s$ can act as a base point in the definition of $\pi_1$ of $X$.

The same phenomenon occurs in the profinite theory of $\pi_1$, and in the "de Rham" theory.
Be aware that $\mathcal{B}(v)=\mathcal{B}(\lambda v)$ for real $\lambda>0$, but that this fact has no analogue in the other theories.
There constructions are explained in [ยง15](#section-15).
\oldpage{8 (86)}
They allow us, in the definition of the motivic $\pi_1$ of $X$, to take a base point "at infinity", like the tangent vector $v$ at $s$.

Let $X=\PP^1\setminus\{0,1,\infty\}$.
An algebraic meaning of "base point close to $0$" is "non-zero tangent vector at $0$".
For such a base point $b$, the monodromy around $0$ has a motivic meaning: it is a morphism of motivic groups
$$
  \ZZ(1) \to \pi_1(X,b)_\mot.
$$
Here and later on, $\pi_1$ is the pro-unipotent $\pi_1$, defined as the projective limit of the motivic groups $\pi_1(X,b)_\mot^{(N)}$.

We take the base point to be the tangent vector $1$ at $0$.
We have a good reduction $\mod p$ for every $p$, and $\pi_1(X,b)_\mot^{(N)}$ is a linear group in the Tannakian category of motives over $\Spec(\ZZ)$ that are iterated extensions of Tate motives.
[ยง8](#section-8) states a conjecture on the $\Ext^1(\QQ,\QQ(k))$ in this category, as well as some consequences.
At the end of [ยง16](#section-16), we make these explicit in the case of $\pi_1(X,b)_\mot^{(N)}$.
I hope that this places the $\zeta(3)$ discovered by Z. Wojtkoviak in its natural setting.
[ยง6](#section-6) is preliminary.
For the essential idea, see [(6.2)](#chunk-6.2).

To define the motivic $\pi_1$, we need to patch together the various theories of $\pi_1$ that we have at our disposal, guided by the goal of constructing a motivic group in the sense of [ยง5](#section-5), explained in [ยง7](#section-7).
This is done in [ยง10](#section-10) to [ยง13](#section-13), after a reminder ([ยง9](#section-9)) on the Malฤev theory of nilpotent groups and their Lie algebras.
The result leaves much to be desired.
It is only completely studied for smooth algebraic varieties whose smooth compactifications $\overline{X}$ satisfy $H^1(\overline{X},\scr{O})=0$.
Another complaint: I sometimes only sketch the definition of structures that will be used in future calculations.

In [ยง16](#section-16), we finally explain what the $\ZZ(k)$-torsors from [ยง3](#section-3) have to do with the $\pi_1$ of the projective line minus three points.
The justifying calculations are given in [ยง19](#section-19).
We give, in [ยง17](#section-17) and [ยง18](#section-18), a geometric explanation of some of their properties.

Let $G$ be a sheaf of groups on a site $\cal{S}$, or, equivalently, in a topos $T$.
Useful particular case: if $\cal{S}$ is a point, then a sheaf is a set and $G$ is a group.
A _$G$-torsor_, or _torsor under $G$_, is a sheaf $P$ endowed with a right $G$-action such that $P$ is locally isomorphic to $G$ acting on itself by translations on the right.
We also call such an object a _right $G$-principal homogeneous space_, or a _right principal homogeneous space under $G$_.
\oldpage{10 (88)}
If $P$ is a $G$-torsor, then a sheaf $X$ on which $G$ acts can be _twisted_ by $P$.
The twisting $X^P$ is the contracted product $P\times^G X=(P\times X)/G$, and is endowed with $\alpha\colon P\to\shIsom(X,X^P)$ satisfying $\alpha(pg)=\alpha(p)g$.

An _$(H,G)$-bitorsor_ (cf. SGA 7, VII.1, or Girard, _Cohomologie non abelienne_, III 1.5) is a space which is simultaneously a left principal homogeneous space under $H$ and a right principal homogeneous space under $G$, with the $G$- and $H$-actions commuting with one another.
If $P$ is a $G$-torsor, then the sheaf of automorphisms of $P$ is the twisting $G^P$ of $G$ by $P$ (under the action of $G$ on itself by inner automorphisms), and $P$ is a $(G^P,P)$-bitorsor.
By this construction, the data of an $(H,G)$-bitorsor $P$ is equivalent to the data of a $G$-torsor $P$ along with an isomorphism between $H$ and $G^P$.
_Notation:_ we will write ${}_HP_G$ to mean that $P$ is an $(H,G)$-bitorsor.

We will use the following operations on torsors and bitorsors.

- **Pushing forward:** (or **transporting**) a $G$-torsor $P$ by $\varphi\colon G\to H$ to obtain an $H$-torsor $\varphi(P)$.
    A _$\varphi$-morphism_ from the $G$-torsor $P$ to the $H$-torsor $Q$ is some $u\colon P\to Q$ such that $u(pg)=u(p)\varphi(g)$.
    A $\varphi$-morphism factors uniquely through an isomorphism of $H$-torsors between $\varphi(P)$ and $Q$.

- **Composition:** of a $(G_1,G_2)$-bitorsor $P$ and a $(G_2,G_3)$-bitorsor $Q$:
    the $(G_1,G_3)$-bitorsor $P\circ Q$ given by the contracted product $P\times^{G_2}Q=(P\times Q)/G_2$.

- **Inverse:** of ${}_{G_1}P_{G_2}$:
    the $(G_2,G_1)$-bitorsor $P^{-1}$, unique up to isomorphism, endowed with $(p\mapsto p^{-1})\colon P\to P^{-1}$ such that $(g_1pg_2)^{-1}=g_2^{-1}p^{-1}g_1^{-1}$.

    For $G$-torsors $P$ and $Q$, the sheaf $\shIsom(P,Q)$ of isomorphisms of $G$-torsors from $P$ to $Q$ is the $(G^Q,G^P)$-bitorsor $G\circ P^{-1}$.

If the site $\cal{S}$ is such that the representable functors $h_S$ are sheaves, then we can transport these operations to $\cal{S}$ via the fully faithful functor $S\mapsto h_S$, with each construction only being defined if it does not leave the collection of representable sheaves.

For algebraic varieties, we have various parallel cohomology theories.
The most important for us will be de Rham and $\ell$-adic cohomology.

- **De Rham cohomology.**
    Let $k$ be a field of characteristic $0$, and $X$ an algebraic variety over $k$.
    Suppose that $X$ is smooth.
    The de Rham cohomology groups $\HH_\DR^i(X)$ are the hypercohomology groups of the de Rham complex:
    $$
      \HH_\DR^i(X)
      \coloneqq \bHH^i(X,\Omega_{X/k}^\bullet)
    $$
    cf. [@G].
    These are vector spaces over $k$.
    If $k'$ is an extension of $k$, and $X'$ over $k'$ is given by extension of scalars of $X$, then
    $$
      \HH_\DR^i(X') = \HH_\DR^i(X)\otimes_k k'.
    $$
    If $X$ is not smooth, then the de Rham complex no longer gives a reasonable theory.
    We can define the $\HH_\DR^i(X)$ by reduction to the smooth case, by the methods of [@D3], or, if $X$ admits an embedding into a smooth variety $Z$, as the hypercohomology of the de Rham complex of the formal completion of $Z$ along $X$ (R. Hartshorne, _On the de Rham cohomology of algebraic varieties_, Publ. Math. IHES **45** (1975), p. 5--99);
    more intrinsically, it is the crystalline cohomology of $X$ (A. Grothendieck, _Crystals and the de Rham cohomology of schemes_, Notes by J. Coates and O. Jussila, in: "dix exposรฉs sur la cohomologie des schรฉmas", North Holland (1968)).

- **$\ell$-adic cohomology.**
    Let $\ell$ be a prime number;
    if $k$ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic $\neq\ell$, then we have the $\ell$-adic theory $X\mapsto\HH^i(X,\QQ_\ell)$ that associates, to $X$ over $k$, cohomology groups which are vector spaces over $\QQ_\ell$ (cf. SGA 5, VI).
    They are defined from the cohomology groups with coefficients in $\ZZ/(\ell^n)$, and we allow ourselves to give, as reference for a theorem in $\ell$-adic cohomology, the place where its $\ZZ/(\ell^n)$ analogue is proved.
    The $\HH^i(X,\QQ_\ell)$ depend only on $X$.
    In particular, if $k$ is the algebraic closure of $k_0$, and if $X$ is given by extension of scalars of some $X_0$ over $k_0$, then $\Gal(k/k_0)$ acts (semi-$k$-linearly) on $X$, and thus acts on the $\HH^i(X,\QQ_\ell)$.
    This action is continuous.
    If $k'$ is an algebraically closed extension of $k$, and if $X'$ is given by extension of scalars of $X$, then $\HH^i(X,\QQ_\ell)\xrightarrow{\sim}\HH^i(X',\QQ_\ell)$.
    \oldpage{12 (90)}
    This follows by passing to the limit in the base change theorem for a smooth morphism [SGA 4, XVI, 1.2]: $k'$ is the filtrant inductive limit of the $k$-algebras $A$ with $\Spec(A)$ smooth over $k$.

If $k=\CC$, then we have the topological space $X(\CC)$ of points of $X$, as well as its rational cohomology $\HH^\bullet(X(\CC),\QQ)$.
We have canonical isomorphisms from [@G] and [SGA4, XVI, 4.1]:

::: {.eqtag #equation-1.1.1}
$$
  \HH_\DR^i(X) = \HH^i(X(\CC),\QQ)\otimes_{\QQ}\CC
\tag{1.1.1}

$$
  \HH^i(X,\QQ_\ell) = \HH^i(X(\CC),\QQ)\otimes_{\QQ}\QQ_\ell.
\tag{1.1.2}
$$
:::

If $k$ is a field of characteristic $0$, and $\sigma\colon k\to\CC$ a complex embedding, with $\bar{k}$ the algebraic closure of $k$ in $\CC$ via $\sigma$, then we obtain the isomorphisms

::: {.eqtag #equation-1.1.3}

where $X(\CC)$ is the topological space of points of the complex algebraic variety given by the extension of scalars via $\sigma$ of $X$.

The existence of parallel cohomology theories lead A. Grothendieck to conjecture the existence, for all base fields $k$, of a motivic theory $X\mapsto\HH_\mot^i(X)$, defined on algebraic varieties (i.e. schemes of finite type) over $k$ and with values in a category $\cal{M}(k)$ (to be defined) of motives over $k$.
The known theories would then be deduced from the motivic theory by applying _realisation_ functors.

The category $\cal{M}(k)$ should be an abelian category, with $\Hom$ groups of finite dimension over $\QQ$.
It should be endowed with a tensor product $\otimes\colon\cal{M}(k)\times\cal{M}(k)\to\cal{M}(k)$ and associativity and commutative data $(X\otimes Y)\otimes Z\simto X\otimes(Y\otimes Z)$ and $X\otimes Y\to Y\otimes X$ satisfying the usual properties
--- more precisely, making $\cal{M}(k)$ into a Tannakian category [@Sa; @DM; @D4].
By the theory of Tannakian categories, $\cal{M}(k)$ would be the category of representations of a gerbe whose band is affine over $\Spec(\QQ)$.
For $k$ of characteristic $0$, the category $\cal{M}(k)$ with its tensor product should be equivalent to the category of representations of an scheme in affine groups (i.e. a proalgebraically affine group) over $\QQ$.

Each $\HH_\mot^i(X)$ would be a contravariant functor in $X$.
We should also have Kรผnneth isomorphisms

Each of the known cohomological theories should give rise to a "realisation" functor, compatible with the tensor product.
For example, for $k$ of characteristic $0$, we would have
$$
  \real_\DR\colon\cal{M}(k)
  \to \text{vector spaces over }k
$$
and, for $X$ an algebraic variety over $k$, a functorial isomorphism
$$
  \HH_\DR^i(X) = \real_\DR\HH_\mot^i(X)
$$
compatible with the Kรผnneth isomorphisms.

The subcategory of $\cal{M}(k)$ _generated_ by a set $\cal{M}$ of motives is defined to be the smallest full subcategory of $\cal{M}(k)$ containing $\cal{M}$ that is stable under $\oplus$, $\otimes$, taking the dual, and sub-quotients.
If we only consider certain algebraic varieties $X$ over $k$, then it can be useful to consider, instead of $\cal{M}(k)$, the subcategory generated by the $\HH^i(X)$.

::: {.rmenv #chunk-1.2 title="1.2" latex="{1.2}"}
If we only consider smooth and projective varieties over a field $k$, and we assume the "standard" conjectures on algebraic cycles, then Grothendieck has shown how to define the category of motives generated by the $\HH_\mot^i(X)$ (cf. [@Kl; @Man]);
it is a semi-simple abelian category.

If we do not restrict ourselves to the category generated by the $\HH_\mot^i(X)$ for $X$ smooth and projective over $k$, then we no longer have even a conjectural definition of what the category of motives over $k$ should be.
However, the philosophy of motives is not made any less useful by this fact:
it organises known facts, poses questions, and suggests precise conjectures.
:::

\oldpage{14 (92)}

::: {.rmenv #chunk-1.3 title="1.3" latex="{1.3}"}
In each of the known theories, the $\HH^i(X)$ are endowed with an increasing filtration $W$, known as the _weight filtration_ [@D5], as well as comparison isomorphisms such that [(1.1.1)](#equation-1.1.1) and [(1.1.2)](#equation-1.1.2) are compatible with $W$.
Furthermore, every natural map is strictly compatible with $W$.
From this, we get a new requirement for the category of motives:
every motive is endowed with a weight filtration $W$, compatible with the tensor product, and strictly compatible with every morphism $f\colon M\to N$, i.e.
$$
  f(M)\cap W_i(N)
  = f(W_i(M)).
$$

We say that a motive $M$ is _pure of weight $i$_ if $W_i(M)=M$ and $W_{i-1}(M)=0$.
For $X$ smooth and projective, $\HH_\mot^i(X)$ is pure of weight $i$.
We want for the $\otimes$-category generated by the $\HH_\mot^i(X)$, for $X$ smooth and projective over $k$, to be the sum of pure motives.
In terms of pure motives, the properties of $W$ can be written as follows:
every motive is the iterated extension of pure motives, and, for $M$ and $N$ pure of weights $m$ and $n$ (respectively),

a. $M\otimes N$ is pure of weight $m+n$;
b. for $m\neq n$, $\Hom(M,N)=0$; and
c. for $m\leq n$, $\Ext^1(M,N)=0$.

Often, pure motives (or direct sums of pure motives) are simply called _motives_, and their category admits the conjectural description [@Kl; @Man];
the more general motives, considered here, are then called _mixed motives_
:::

If we cannot define the category of motives, we can at least describe a sequence of compatibilities between the $\HH^i(X)$ taken in the various cohomological theories, i.e. describe compatibilities that should exist between the various realisations of a motive.

i. If $M_\DR$ is given, then the data of $M_\BB$, $F_\infty$, and $\comp_{\DR,\BB}$ satisfying [(AM2)](#AM2) is equivalent to that of a new rational structure $M_\BB\subset M_\DR\otimes\CC$ that is stable under complex conjugation $c_\DR$ (set $F_\infty=c_\DR|M_\BB$).
    By [(M6)](#M6), the filtration $W$ of $M_\DR$ must remain rational for this new rational structure.

ii. The data of $M_\AAf$, $\comp_{\AAf,\BB}$, and the Galois action, all together, are equivalent to the data of a $\QQ_\ell$-vector space $M_\ell$ for all $\ell$, along with a Galois action on $M_\ell$ and comparison isomorphisms $\comp_{\ell,\BB}\colon M_\BB\otimes\QQ\simto M_\ell$.
    We have to assume the existence of a lattice $L\subset M_\BB$ such that the $\comp_{\ell,\BB}(L\otimes\ZZ_\ell)$ are Galois stable.
    We define $M_\AAf$ from the $M_\ell$ as the restricted product of the $M_\ell$ with respect to the $\comp_{\ell,\BB}(L\otimes\ZZ_\ell)$ for an arbitrary lattice $L$: this restricted product is Galois stable, and the $\comp_{\ell,\BB}$ induce $\comp_{\AAf,\BB}$.

    The data of $M_\ell$, $\comp_{\ell,\BB}$, and the Galois action (resp. $M_\AAf$, $\comp_{\AAf,\BB}$, and the action), all together, are also equivalent to the data of a Galois action on $M_\BB\otimes\QQ_\ell$ (resp. $M_\BB\otimes\AAf$).
    By [(M6)](#M6) and [(M9)](#M9), the filtration of $M_\BB\otimes\QQ_\ell$ (resp. $M_\BB\otimes\AAf$) induced by $W$ must be stable under $\Gal(\bar{\QQ}/\QQ)$.

iii. If $M_\DR$ is given, then the data of $M_{\crisp}$, along with its crystalline Frobenius and $\comp_{\crisp,\DR}$, is equivalent to the data of an automorphism $\phi_p$ of $M_\DR\otimes\QQ_p$.
    By [(M6)](#M6) and [(M10)](#M10), the filtration of $M_\DR\otimes\QQ_p$ induced by $W$ must be stable under $\phi_p$.

We will often tacitly use these remarks to describe a system [(M1)--(M10)](#chunk-1.4).

::: {.rmenv #chunk-1.6 title="1.6" latex="{1.6}"}
A scheme $X$ of finite type over $\QQ$ should define, for each $i$, a motive $M\coloneqq \HH_\mot^i(X)$.
\oldpage{17 (95)}
In this section, we will partially describe the system [(M1)--(M10)](#chunk-1.4) of realisations of $M$ in the case where $X$ is separated and smooth over $\QQ$.

We have $M_\BB=\HH^i(X(\CC),\QQ)$, and $F_\infty$ is induced by the complex conjugation of $X(\CC)$;
$M_\DR=\HH_\DR^i(X)\coloneqq\bHH^i(X,\Omega_X^\bullet)$, and the Hodge filtration that that of the mixed Hodge theory [@D2, Section 3.2];
$M_\ell=\HH^i(X\otimes\bar{\QQ},\QQ_\ell)$ is the $\ell$-adic รฉtale cohomology of the scheme over $\bar{\QQ}$ induced from $X$ by extension of scalars, and the action of $\Gal(\bar{\QQ},\QQ)$ is given by structure transport.
_Notation:_ $X\otimes\bar{\QQ}$, cf. [(0.4)](#chunk-0.4).

Suppose that $X$ is smooth and proper, and let $S$ be a finite set of prime numbers such that $X$ is the general fibre of $X^\sim$, which is smooth and proper over $\Spec(\ZZ)\setminus S$.
For $p\not\in S$, $M_\crisp$ is the crystalline cohomology of the reduction $X^\sim\otimes\FF_p$ of $X$ modulo $p$, tensored over $\ZZ_p$ with $\QQ_p$.
The crystalline Frobenius $\phi_p$ is induced by the inverse image morphism of the Frobenius $\Fr\colon X^\sim\otimes\FF_p\to X^\sim\otimes\FF_p$.

More generally, suppose that we have some smooth and proper $\overline{X}$ over $\Spec(\ZZ)\setminus S$, as well as a relative normal crossing divisor $D$;
let $X$ be the general fibre of $\overline{X}\setminus D$.
Then the realisation $M_\crisp$ is defined for $p\not\in S$;
its most natural definition is given by the generalisation of the crystalline theory, considered by Faltings in [@Fa, IV], to the "logarithmic poles" case.

The comparison isomorphism $\comp_{\DR,\BB}$ is [(1.1.3)](#equation-1.1.3), and the comparison isomorphism $\comp_{\ell,\BB}$ is [(1.1.4)](#equation-1.1.4).

In the smooth and proper case, the comparison isomorphism $\comp_{\crisp,\DR}$ comes from ยง7.26 of [P. Berthelot and A. Ogus, _Notes on crystalline cohomology_, Princeton University Press and Tokyo University Press, 1978].
For the general case, see [@Fa, IV].
Finally, the weight filtration $W$ is that of the mixed Hodge theory from [@D2, Section 3.2].
See also [@D5].

::: {.rmenv #chunk-1.7 title="1.7" latex="{1.7}"}
An additional data that we have on the cohomology $M\coloneqq\HH_\mot^i(X)$ when $X$ is smooth over $\QQ$ is that of a comparison isomorphism, for almost all $p$, in the sense of Fontaine--Messing (cf. [@FM; @Fa]), relating $M_p$, endowed with the action of a decomposition group of $p$, to $M_\DR\otimes\QQ_p$, endowed with its Hodge filtration and its crystalline Frobenius.

For all $p$, we should also have a "crystalline" structure of the following type.

- **Semi-stable case.**
    Let $T_p$ be the Zariski tangent space of $\Spec(\ZZ_p)$ at its closed point.
\oldpage{18 (96)}
    We complete it to a projective line $\overline{T}_p$ over $\FF_p$, and we can lift $(\overline{T}_p,0,\infty)$ to a projective line endowed with two marked points over $\ZZ_p$: $(\overline{T}_p^\sim,0,\infty)$.
    We want an $F$-isocrystal with logarithmic poles on $(\overline{T}_p,0,\infty)$ (cf. [@Fa]).
    Such an object induces, on $\overline{T}_p^\sim\otimes\QQ_p$, a module with connection $\cal{V}$ with logarithmic poles at $0$ and at $\infty$, and we want for the residue of the connection at $0$ and at $\infty$ to be nilpotent.
    If $\varphi$ is a section of $\overline{T}_p^\sim$, over $\Spec(\ZZ_p)$, with derivative equal to $1$ at the closed point, then $\varphi^*\cal{V}$ is independent of the choice of $\varphi$, and $\comp_{\DR,\crisp}$ should then be identified with the de Rham realisation $\otimes\QQ_p$.

- **General case.**
    The data of the previous type, over a large-enough finite Galois extension $E$ of $\QQ_p$ that is $\Gal(E/\QQ_p)$-equivariant.

A Fontaine--Messing comparison isomorphism should again link this object and $M_p$ endowed with the action of a decomposition group of $p$.

:::

We understand [(M4)](#M4), $\comp_{\crisp,\DR}$, and [(M10)](#M10) as a germ --- in the filter of complements of finite sets of prime numbers --- of systems of automorphisms $\phi_p$ of the $M_\DR\otimes\QQ_p$

:::{.itenv #chunk-1.10 title="Proposition 1.10" latex="{Proposition 1.10}"}
Realisation systems form a Tannakian category.
:::

::: {.proof}
As in [@J], the key point is that a morphism of mixed Hodge $\QQ$-structures is strictly compatible with the filtrations $W$ and $F$, and that its kernel and cokernel are mixed Hodge $\QQ$-structures [@D2, Theorem 2.3.5].
We thus deduce that every morphism of realisation systems is strictly compatible with $W$ and $F$.
(For $W$, we can instead use [(AM4)](#AM4).)

So it is clear that the kernels and cokernels again form realisation systems, and that a bijective morphism is an isomorphism.
We have direct sums, and so the category is abelian.

We have an obvious tensor product, which is associative and commutative, and a way of taking duals.
We also have a fibre functor, or, indeed, two: ${}_\BB$ and ${}_\DR$, with values in $\QQ$-vector spaces.
The category of realisation systems is thus Tannakian and **TO-DO**: the fibre functor ${}_\BB$ (resp. ${}_\DR$) identifies it with the category of representations of the group scheme $G_\BB$ (resp. $G_\DR$) of its automorphisms (cf. [@Sa] or [@DM, Theorem 2.11]).

\oldpage{19 (97)}

We hope that the realisation functors define a fully faithful functor from the category of motives over $\QQ$ to the category of realisation systems.
If this were not the case, then the philosophy of motives would lose much of its interest.
This leads to the following provisional "definition":

::: {.rmenv #chunk-1.11 title="1.11 Definition" latex="{1.11 Definition}"}

This definition is not really a definition, since "of geometric origin" has not been defined.
Worse still, I do not have any definition to propose that I can confidently say is good.

::: {.rmenv #chunk-1.12 title="1.12 Remark" latex="{1.12 Remark}"}
We would hope that the realisations of motives have properties not included in the definition [(1.9)](#chunk-1.9) of realisation systems.
Some reasons for not including them:

a. we do not know how to verify them in practice;
b. we no longer know how to prove [(1.10)](#chunk-1.10) if we do include them.

Thus.

i. We would like that, for almost all $p$, the Frobenius characteristic polynomial $\det(1-F_pt,M_\ell)$ at $p$ have rational coefficients that are independent of $\ell\neq p$.
    It should also agree with $\det(1-\phi_pt,M_\crisp)$.
    We do not know how to verify this for $\HH_\mot^i(X)$ (with $X$ smooth), nor for a direct factor of $\HH_\mot^i(X)$ (with $X$ an abelian variety), and reason (b) above also applies.

ii. We would like to complete [(AM4)](#AM4) by a condition for all $p$, cf. 1.8.5 in [P. Deligne, "La conjecture de Weil II", _Publ. Math. IHES_ **52** (1980), 137--252].
    Reasons (a) and (b) above also apply.

iii. The Hodge structure $\Gr_n^W(M_\BB)$ should be polarisable.
    More precisely, there should exist, for all $n$, a morphism of realisation systems
    $$
      \Gr_n^W(M)\otimes\Gr_n^W(M) \to \QQ(-n)
    $$
    (see [(2.1)](#chunk-2.1) for the definition of $\QQ(-n)$) that induces a polarisation of the weight-$n$ Hodge structure $\Gr_n^W(M_\BB)=\Gr_n^W(M_\BB)$.
    Here, neither reason (a) nor reason (b) apply.

An $\AAf$-sheaf $M_\AAf$ on $\Spec(\QQ)$.
:::

By "$\AAf$-sheaf" we mean the data, for all $\ell$, of a $\QQ_\ell$-sheaf $\cal{F}_\ell$, and, for almost all $\ell$, of a $\ZZ_\ell$-sheaf $\cal{F}_{\ZZ_\ell}\subset\cal{F}_\ell$ which generates $\cal{F}_\ell$: the germ of the system of the $\cal{F}_{\ZZ_\ell}$ is given.
On the spectrum of a field $k$, the data of $\cal{F}_\ell$ (resp. $\cal{F}_{\ZZ_\ell}$) is equivalent to that of, for every algebraic closure $\bar{k}$ of $k$, a $\QQ_\ell$-vector space $\cal{F}_\ell(\bar{k})$ (resp. a $\ZZ_\ell$-module $\cal{F}_{\ZZ_\ell}(\bar{k})$ of finite type), functorially in $\bar{k}$, and such that the action of $\Gal(\bar{k}/k)$ is continuous.
Note that $\cal{F}_\AAf(\bar{k})$ is the restricted product of the $\cal{F}_\ell(\bar{k})$ with respect to the $\cal{F}_{\ZZ_\ell}(\bar{k})$.

From [(M'3)](#Mp3), we deduce the data of [(M3)](#M3) and [(M9)](#M9) by setting $M_\AAf\coloneqq(M_\AAf)_\AAf(\bar{\QQ})$.
_Notation:_ we write $M_\ell$ (resp. $M_{\ZZ_\ell}$, $M_\AAf$) for $(M_\AAf)_\ell$ (resp. $(M_\AAf)_{\ZZ_\ell}$, $(M_\AAf)_\AAf$).

If $M=\HH_\mot^i(X)$, and $a$ is the morphism $X\to\Spec(\QQ)$, then $M_\ell=\RR^ia_*\QQ_\ell$, and $M_{\ZZ_\ell}$ is equal to the image of $\RR^ia_*\ZZ_\ell$ in $M_\ell$.
We have that $\RR^ia_*\ZZ_\ell(\bar{k})=\HH^i(X\otimes_\QQ\bar{k},\ZZ_\ell)$.

A definition essentially equivalent to [(1.9)](#chunk-1.9) is then the following: a _realisation system_ is a system [(M'1)](#Mp1) to [(M'6)](#Mp6), and [(M'8)](#Mp8), satisfying axioms [(AM1)](#AM1), [(AM2)](#AM2), and [(AM4)](#AM4) (suitably modified in the evident way).

The data of [(M'1)](#Mp1) is equivalent to a sheaf of $\QQ$-vector spaces on the รฉtale site of $\Spec\RR$.
From this point of view, $\comp_{\ell,\BB}$ is an isomorphism to $\Spec(\RR)_\et$ between the inverse image of $M_\ell$ and the $\QQ_\ell$-sheaf induced by $M_\BB$.

In the language of sheaves, [(AM3)](#AM3) implies that $M_\ell$ comes from a smooth $\QQ_\ell$-sheaf on $\Spec(\ZZ)\setminus S\setminus\{\ell\}$.
The language of sheaves makes it clear that, for all $p$, $M_\ell$ defines a $\QQ_\ell$-sheaf on $\Spec(\QQ_p)$ (cf. the analogous case of $\RR$ below).
The choice of a decomposition group is not required.

Let $P$ be a finite set of prime numbers.
The category of *smooth realisation systems on $\Spec(\ZZ)\setminus P$* is defined as in [(1.9)](#chunk-1.9), taking $P$ to be the exceptional set $S$ in [(AM3)](#AM3), and replacing "almost all $p$" in [(M4)](#M4) and [(AM4)](#AM4) by "all $p\not\in P$".
This treatment of crystalline structures is not satisfying, cf. [(1.7)](#chunk-1.7).
The category [(1.9)](#chunk-1.9) of realisation systems on $\Spec(\QQ)$ is the inductive limit of these categories for $P$ growing larger and larger.

Instead of saying "smooth over $\Spec(\ZZ)\setminus P$", we also say "of good reduction outside of $P$".
This terminology is erroneous in that the categories in question are not subcategories of the category of realisation systems on $\Spec(\QQ)$ (cf. [(1.7)](#chunk-1.7) again).

\oldpage{22 (100)}

In the language of [(1.14)](#chunk-1.14), in [(M'3)](#Mp3) we need to give $M_\ell$ as a smooth $\QQ_\ell$-sheaf on $\Spec(\ZZ[1/\ell])\setminus P$ instead of on $\Spec(\QQ)$, and we need to modify [(M'4)](#Mp4) like [(M4)](#M4).

The objects [(1.15)](#chunk-1.15) belonging to the subcategory generated by the objects of geometric origin (cf. [(1.11)](#chunk-1.11)) will be called *smooth (mixed) motives on $\Spec(\ZZ)\setminus P$*.
We hope that this gives a full subcategory of the category of motives on $\Spec(\QQ)$.

We would like to have a notion of smooth motive on $S$ for more general base spaces than $\Spec(\ZZ)\setminus P$.
Our methods, where the Betti realisation plays a central role, require that $S_\QQ$ be dense in $S$.
We will outline a provisional definition of smooth realisation systems on $S$, for $S$ smooth over $\Spec(\ZZ)$.
The case where $S$ is open in the spectrum of the ring of integers of a number field can be dealt with using natural modifications of [(1.4)](#chunk-1.4) and [(1.15)](#chunk-1.15).
For $S$ finite and รฉtale over an open of $\Spec(\ZZ)$, we can also reduce to [(1.15)](#chunk-1.15): see [(1.17)](#chunk-1.17).

(The motivic $\HH^0$ of the spectrum of a number field).

Let $E$ be a finite extension of $\QQ$, unramified outside of a finite set $P$ of prime numbers.
We are going to expand on [(1.6)](#chunk-1.6) for $\Spec(E)$ and, more precisely, define a realisation system $A\coloneqq\HH_\mot^0(\Spec(E))$ that is smooth over $\Spec(\ZZ)\setminus P$.
The motive $A$ is of Hodge type $(0,0)$.
This determines $W$ and $F$.
We have that $A_\DR=E$, viewed as a vector space over $\QQ$.

Let $\Hom(E,\CC)=\Spec(E)(\CC)$ be the set of homomorphisms (which are automatically embeddings) from $E$ to $\CC$.
We have that $A_\BB=\QQ^{\Hom(E,\CC)}$, with $F_\infty$ induced by the complex conjugation of $\CC$.
The comparison isomorphism $\DR/\BB$ from $A_\BB\otimes\CC=\CC^{\Hom(E,\CC)}$ to $A_\DR\otimes\CC=E\otimes\CC$ is the $\CC$-linear extension of the map
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    E &\longrightarrow \CC^{\Hom(E,\CC)}
  \\e &\longmapsto (\sigma\mapsto\sigma(e)).
  \end{aligned}
$$

Since every embedding of $E$ into $\CC$ factors through $\bar{\QQ}$, $\Gal(\bar{\QQ}/\QQ)$ acts on $\Hom(E,\CC)$,
This action induces the Galois action on $A_\AAf\coloneqq A_\BB\otimes\AAf$ (cf. [(1.5.ii)](#chunk-1.5)).

For $p\not\in P$, and $v$ running over the places of $E$ over $p$, we have that $E\otimes\QQ_p=\prod E_v$, and $\phi_p$ is the automorphism of $E\otimes\QQ_p$ that induces on each $E_v$ the unique lift of the Frobenius $x\mapsto x^p$ of the residue field (cf. [(1.5.iii)](#chunk-1.5)).

The complex torus $A(\CC)$ determines the abelian variety $A_\CC$ over $\CC$ induced by $A$, and the $\QQ$-structure is uniquely determined by that of the Lie algebra.

An abelian scheme $A$ over $S$ similarly defines a smooth motive with integer coefficients $T(A)$ over $S$.

Recall that a *smooth $1$-motive* $X$ over a scheme $S$ consists of

a. a group scheme $L$ over $S$ that, locally, for the รฉtale topology, is a constant group scheme defined by a free $\ZZ$-module of finite type;
    an abelian scheme $A$ over $S$, and a torus $T$ over $S$;
b. an extension $E$ of $A$ by $T$, and a morphism $\bar{u}\colon L\to A$;
c. a morphism $u\colon L\to E$ lifting $\bar{u}$.

We write $X=[L\xrightarrow{u}E]$.

A $1$-motive $X$ over $\QQ$ defines a motive over $\QQ$ with integer coefficients $T(X)$ (cf. [@D3, Section 10, but the crystalline aspect is missing]), and the functor $X\mapsto T(X)$ is fully faithful (cf. [@D3, both 10.1.3 and 2.2]).

For $X=[\ZZ\to0]$, $T(X)$ is the unit motive $\ZZ(0)$.
For $X=[0\to\Gm]$, $T(X)$ is the Tate motive $\ZZ(1)$.
For an abelian variety $A$ and $X=[0\to A]$, $T(X)=T(A)$.
Of course, here, as in [(2.2)](#chunk-2.2), we can take more general bases than $\Spec(\QQ)$.

I conjecture that the set of motives with integer coefficients of the form $T(X)$ for some $1$-motive $X$ is stable under extensions.
If $T'$ is a motive with integer coefficients, with $T'\otimes\QQ\simto T(X)\otimes\QQ$, then $T'$ is of the form $T(X')$ with $X'$ isogenous to $X$.
The conjecture is thus equivalent to the claim that the set of motives $T(X)\otimes\QQ$, for $1$-motives $X$, is stable under extensions.
The word "conjecture" is an abuse of terminology, since the statement itself is not precise.
What is conjectured is that every realisation system [(1.9)](#chunk-1.9) (or [(1.24)](#chunk-1.24), over $S$) that is an extension $T(X)$ by $T(Y)$ (for $1$-motives $X$ and $Y$), and "natural", "coming from geometry", is isomorphic to that defined by a $1$-motive $Z$ that is an extension of $X$ by $Y$.

A point $a$ of an abelian variety $A$ over $\QQ$ defines a $1$-motive $[\ZZ\xrightarrow{u}A]$ with $u(1)=a$.
The motive $T([\ZZ\xrightarrow{u}A])$ is an extension of $\ZZ(0)$ by $T(A)$, and the conjecture, applied to $\ZZ(0)$ and $T(A)$, implies that
$$
  A(\QQ) \simto \Ext^1(\ZZ(0),T(A))
$$
or, equivalently,
$$
  A(\QQ)\otimes\QQ \simto \Ext^1(\QQ(0),T(A)\otimes\QQ)
$$
(where $\Ext^1$ is in the abelian category of motives).

More generally, if $E$ is an extension of an abelian variety by a torus, we want
$$
  E(\QQ) \simto \Ext^1(\ZZ(0),T(E))
$$
and similarly for more general bases that $\Spec(\QQ)$.

The case $E=\Gm$ is particularly interesting: for every smooth scheme $S$ over $\Spec(\ZZ)$, we want, in the category of motives with integer coefficients over $S$,

As in [(2.5)](#chunk-2.5), such an extension is described by a system of torsors.

We note only that, in the de Rham realisation, $P_\DR$ is an $M_\DR$-torsor on $S_\QQ$.
It is endowed with a restriction of the structure group $F^0P_\DR\subset P_\DR$ to $F^0M_\DR$.
It is also endowed with an integrable connection $\nabla$.
Along each section $p$ of $P_\DR$, the vertical tangent space can be identified with $M_\DR$;
the connection $\nabla$ is thus a morphism

We explicitly describe the torsor in motives $K(x)$ under $\ZZ(1)$ (the *Kummer torsor*) corresponding to $x\in\QQ^\times$ as in [(2.4.1)](#chunk-2.4.1).

The $\ZZ(1)_\BB$-torsor $K(x)_\BB$ is the torsor under $2\pi i\ZZ$ of logarithms of $x$.
Since $F^0\ZZ(1)_\DR=0$, we have $K(x)_\DR=\ZZ(1)_\DR=\QQ$.
The $\ZZ/(n)(1)$-torsor $K(x)_{\ZZ/(n)}$ is the torsor of $n$-th roots of unity of $x$.
The transition morphisms $K(x)/_{\ZZ(nm)}\to K(x)_{\ZZ/(n)}$ are given by $y\mapsto y^m$.
The Galois action is evident.

The morphism $\comp_{\DR,\BB}$ is induced by the inclusion of $K(x)_\BB$ into $\CC$.
The morphism $\comp_{\ZZ/(n),\BB}$ is induced by $K(x)_\BB\to K(x)_{\ZZ/(n)}$ given by $z\mapsto\exp(z/n)$.

The crystalline Frobenius $\phi_p\colon K(x)_\DR\otimes\QQ_p\to K(x)_\DR\otimes\QQ_p$, i.e. $\QQ_p\to\QQ_p$, is defined for $x$ a unit at $p$.
We denote by $\log$ the $p$-adic logarithm, which is characterised by
$$
  \phi_p^{-1}(0) = \log(x^{1-p}).

On $\Gm=\Spec\ZZ[q,q^{-1}]$, the universal section $q$ of $\Gm$ also defines a torsor in motives $K(q)$ under $\ZZ(1)$, on the base $\Gm$.
We now describe it.

The $\ZZ(1)_\BB$-torsor $K(q)_\BB$ on $C^\times$ is the local system of logarithms of $q$.
Since $F^0\ZZ(1)_\DR=0$, $K(q)_\DR$ is trivial: $K(n)_\DR=\OO$ (on ${\Gm}_\QQ$).
It is endowed with the integrable connection $\nabla\colon K(q)_\DR\to\Omega^1\otimes\ZZ(1)_\DR=\Omega^1$ given by
$$
  \nabla u = \dd u - \frac{\dd q}{q}.
$$
The $\ZZ/(n)(1)$-torsor $K(q)_{\ZZ/(n)}$ is that of the $n$-th roots of $q$.
This is a locally constant sheaf on $(\Gm\otimes\ZZ[1/n])_\et$.
Transition and comparison morphisms are defined as in [(2.9)](#chunk-2.9).

We now explain what the $F$-crystal structure is at $p$.
Let $\hGm$ be the completion of $\Gm$ along its fibre of characteristic $p$, and $\hGm\otimes\QQ_p$ the corresponding rigid analytic space.
For a Frobenius lifting $\widetilde{F}\colon\hGm\to\hGm$, the crystalline Frobenius is a morphism $\phi_p[\widetilde{F}]$, over $\hGm\otimes\QQ_p$, from $\widetilde{F}^\bullet K(q)_\DR$ to $K(q)_\DR$ that is horizontal and compatible with the torsor structures.
If we change $\widetilde{F}$ to $\widetilde{F}'$, then $\widetilde{F}$ and $\widetilde{F}'$ have the same reduction modulo $p$, the connection $\nabla$ gives an isomorphism of $\widetilde{F}^\bullet K(q)_\DR$ with $\widetilde{F}'^{\bullet} K(q)_\DR$, and the diagram
$$
  \begin{CD}
    \widetilde{F}^\bullet K(q)_\DR @>{\phi_p[\widetilde{F}]}>> K(q)_\DR
  \\@| @|
  \\\widetilde{F}'^{\bullet} K(q)_\DR @>>{\phi_p[\widetilde{F}']}> K(q)_\DR
  \end{CD}
$$
commutes.

In terms of $\phi_p^{-1}\colon K(q)_\DR\to\widetilde{F}'^{\bullet} K(q)_\DR$, and via the identifications $K(q)_\DR=\ZZ(1)_\DR=\OO$, whence $\widetilde{F}'^{\bullet}=\OO$, the compatibility with the torsor structures and with the connections can be written as
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \phi_p^{-1}(k+m)
    &= \phi_p^{-1}(k) + pm
  \\\dd\phi_p^{-1}(0)
    &= \widetilde{F}^\bullet\left(\frac{\dd q}{q}\right) - p\frac{\dd q}{q}.
  \end{aligned}
$$
When we change the Frobenius lifting, we have
$$
  \phi_p^{-1}[\widetilde{F}'](0) - \phi_p^{-1}[\widetilde{F}](0)
  = \log(\widetilde{F}'/\widetilde{F}).
$$
For $\widetilde{F}\colon q\mapsto q^p$, we have
$$
  \phi_p^{-1}[q\mapsto q^p](0) = 0.
$$
\oldpage{32 (111)}
For $x\in\QQ$ a unit at $p$, and $\widetilde{F}$ such that $\widetilde{F}(x)=x$, we thus have $\phi_p^{-1}[\widetilde{F}](0)=\log(x/x^p)$ at $x$, as required by [(2.9)](#chunk-2.9)
