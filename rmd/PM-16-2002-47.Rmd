In this work, we classify the holomorphic foliations with infinite automorphism group on a rational surface.
As a consequence of this result, we prove that the automorphism group of a foliation of general type with singularities on a rational surface is finite.

# Introduction {#introduction}

\oldpage{48}
Schwarz proved that the automorphism group of a Riemann surface of genus greater than 2 is finite.
Andreotti, in [@1], generalised this result, proving that the group of bimeromorphisms of an algebraic variety of general type is finite, these being analogous to Riemann surfaces of genus greater than 2.
In the case of algebraic surfaces, there is even a bound for this number, see [@14].

In this work we first classify the holomorphic foliations with singularities on rational surfaces.

::: {.rmenv #theorem-A title="Theorem A" latex="{Theorem A}"}
Let $\cal{F}$ be a foliation on a rational surface $M$.
If $\#\Aut(\cal{F})=+\infty$ then $\cal{F}$ is bimeromorphic to a Riccati foliation or to a rational fibration.

We then prove a result analogous to that of Andreotti for holomorphic foliations on rational surfaces (surfaces bimeromorphic to the projective plane).

The automorphism group of a holomorphic foliation of general type with singularities on a rational surface is finite.

# Preliminaries {#preliminaries}

For the basic notions of holomorphic foliations, we recommend the books [@4], [@13], and [@2].
A holomorphic foliation $\cal{F}$ with isolated singularities on an algebraic surface $M$ can be defined by a family of holomorphic vector fields $\{X_i\}$ defined on an open cover $\{U_i\}$ of $M$ satisfying the cocycle condition $X_i=g_{ij}X_j$ whenever $U_i\cap U_j\neq\varnothing$, where the $\{g_{ij}\}$ are nowhere-zero holomorphic functions defined on the $U_i\cap U_j$.
In this case, the $\{g_{ij}\}$ define a line bundle $T_\cal{F}^*$ on $M$ called the *cotangent*, or *canonical*, *bundle*.
The set of singularities $\Sing(\cal{F})$ of $\cal{F}$ is defined as $\Sing(\cal{F})/_{U_i}=\{X_i=0\}$, and it is always possible to suppose that $\dim\Sing(\cal{F})=0$.

Let $\cal{F}$ be a holomorphic foliation on a complex surface $M$.
Consider a compact curve $C$ on $M$.
\oldpage{49}
Let $p\in C$ and let $\{f=0\}$ be a reduced local equation of $C$ around $p$.
Suppose that $\cal{F}$ is represented in a coordinate neighbourhood $(U,(x,y))$ of $p=(0,0)$ by the holomorphic $1$-form
$$
  \omega
  = a(x,y)\dd x + b(x,y) \dd y.
$$
When $C$ is not $\cal{F}$-invariant, we define the *tangency* between $\cal{F}$ and $C$ at $p$ by
$$
  \tang_p(\cal{F},C)=\dim_\CC\frac\cal{O}_p/I
$$
where $I$ is the ideal generated by $f$ and $-b\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}+a\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$.
Define $\tang(\cal{F},C)=\sum_{p\in C}\tang_p(\cal{F},C)$.
It is proven in [@2] that
$$
  T_\cal{F}^*C
  = \tang(\cal{F},C) - C^2.
$$

::: {.rmenv #example-1 title="Example 1" latex="{Example 1}"}
If $M=\CC P(2)$ and $C$ is a non-$\cal{F}$-invariant line, then we have
$$
  T_\cal{F}^*
  = \cal{O}_{\CC P(2)}(\tang(\cal{F},C)-1).
$$
:::

Now suppose that $C$ is $\cal{F}$-invariant, so that $\omega\wedge\dd f=f\Theta$, where $\Theta$ is a holomorphic $2$-form.
Then there exist relatively prime holomorphic functions $g$ and $h$ defined on $U$, along with a holomorphic $1$-form $\eta$, such that
$$
  g\omega
  = h\dd f + f\eta.
$$

We define the *Camacho--Sad index* by
$$
  \CS_p(\cal{F},C)
  = \frac{-1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{\eta}{h}
$$
where $\gamma$ is
