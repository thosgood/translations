In this work we classify holomorphic foliations with infinite automorphism group on a rational surface.
As a consequence of this result, we prove that the automorphism group of a foliation of general type with singularities on a rational surface is finite.

# Introduction

\oldpage{48}

Schwarz proved that the automorphism group of a Riemann surface of genus greater than $2$ is finite.
Andreotti, in [@1], generalises this result, proving that the bimeromorphism group of an algebraic variety of general type is finite, these being analogous to Riemann surfaces of genus greater than $2$.
In the case of algebraic surfaces, there is even a **???** for this number, cf. [@14].

In this work, we first classify holomorphic foliations with singularities on rational surfaces.

::: {.itenv #theorem-A title="Theorem A" latex="{Theorem A}"}
Let $\cal{F}$ be a foliation on a rational surface $M$.
If $\#\Aut(\cal{F})=+\infty$, then $\cal{F}$ is bimeromorphic to a Riccati foliation or a rational fibration.
:::

We then prove a result analogous to that of Andreotti for holomorphic foliations on rational surfaces (surfaces bimeromorphic to the projective plane).

::: {.itenv #theorem-B title="Theorem B" latex="{Theorem B}"}
The automorphism group of a foliation of general type with singularities on a rational surface is finite.

# Preliminaries

For the basic notions of holomorphic foliations, we recommend the books [@4; @13; @2].
A holomorphic foliation $\cal{F}$ with isolated singularities on an algebraic surface $M$ can be defined as a family $\{X_i\}$ of holomorphic vector fields defined on an open cover $\{U_i\}$ of $M$ that satisfies the cocycle condition $X_i=g_{ij}X_j$ whenever $U_i\cap U_j\neq\varnothing$, where $\{g_{ij}\}$ are nowhere-zero holomorphic functions defined on $U_i\cap U_j$.
In this case, $\{g_{ij}\}$ defines a line bundle $T_{\cal{G}}^*$ on $M$ called the _cotangent_ (or _canonical_) _bundle_.
The set of singularities $\Sing(\cal{G})$ of $\cal{G}$ is defined as $\Sing(\cal{G})_{/U_i}=\{X_i=0\}$, and it is always possible to suppose that $\dim(\Sing(\cal{G}))=0$.
