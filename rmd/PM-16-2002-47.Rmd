In this work we classify holomorphic foliations with infinite automorphism group on a rational surface.
As a consequence of this result, we prove that the automorphism group of a foliation of general type with singularities on a rational surface is finite.

# Introduction

\oldpage{48}

Schwarz proved that the automorphism group of a Riemann surface of genus greater than $2$ is finite.
Andreotti, in [@1], generalises this result, proving that the bimeromorphism group of an algebraic variety of general type is finite, these being analogous to Riemann surfaces of genus greater than $2$.
In the case of algebraic surfaces, there is even a **???** for this number, cf. [@14].

In this work, we first classify holomorphic foliations with singularities on rational surfaces.

::: {.itenv #theorem-A title="Theorem A" latex="{Theorem A}"}
Let $\cal{F}$ be a foliation on a rational surface $M$.
If $\num\Aut(\cal{F})=+\infty$, then $\cal{F}$ is bimeromorphic to a Riccati foliation or a rational fibration.
:::

We then prove a result analogous to that of Andreotti for holomorphic foliations on rational surfaces (surfaces bimeromorphic to the projective plane).

# Preliminaries

For the basic notions of holomorphic foliations, we recommend the books [@4; @13; @2].
A holomorphic foliation $\cal{F}$ with isolated singularities on an algebraic surface $M$ can be defined as a family $\{X_i\}$ of holomorphic vector fields defined on an open cover $\{U_i\}$ of $M$ that satisfies the cocycle condition $X_i=g_{ij}X_j$ whenever $U_i\cap U_j\neq\varnothing$, where $\{g_{ij}\}$ are nowhere-zero holomorphic functions defined on $U_i\cap U_j$.
In this case, $\{g_{ij}\}$ defines a line bundle $T_{\cal{G}}^*$ on $M$ called the _cotangent_ (or _canonical_) _bundle_.
The set of singularities $\Sing(\cal{G})$ of $\cal{G}$ is defined as $\Sing(\cal{G})_{/U_i}=\{X_i=0\}$, and it is always possible to suppose that $\dim(\Sing(\cal{G}))=0$.

Let $\cal{F}$ be a holomorphic foliation on a complex surface $M$.
Consider a compact curve $C$ on $M$.
Let $p\in C$, and let $\{f=0\}$ be a reduced local equation of $C$ around $p$.
\oldpage{49}
Suppose that $\cal{F}$ is represented in a coordinate neighbourhood $(U,(x,y))$ of $p=(0,0)$ by the holomorphic $1$-form
$$
  \omega = a(x,y)\dd x + b(x,y)\dd y.
$$
If $C$ is not $F$-invariant, then we define the _tangency_ between $\cal{F}$ and $C$ at $p$ by $\tang_p(\cal{F},C)=\dim_\mathbb{C}\OO_p/I$, where $I$ is the ideal generated by $f$ and $-b\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}+a\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$.
We define $\tang(\cal{F},C)=\sum_{p\in C}\tang_p(\cal{F},C)$.
It is proven in [@2] that 
$$
  T_\cal{F}^*C = \tang(\cal{F},C) - C^2.
$$

::: {.rmenv #example-1 title="Example 1" latex="{Example 1}"}
If $M=\mathbb{C}P(2)$ and $C$ is a non-$\cal{F}$-invariant line, then we have
$$
  T_\cal{F}^* = \OO_{\mathbb{C}P(2)}(\tang(\cal{F},C)-1).
$$
:::

Now suppose that $C$ is $\cal{F}$-invariant, so that $\omega\wedge\dd f=f\Theta$, where $\Theta$ is a holomorphic $2$-form.
Then there exist relatively prime holomorphic functions $g$ and $h$ defined on $U$, along with a holomorphic $1$-form $\eta$, such that
$$
  g\omgea = h\dd f + f\eta.
$$

We define the _Camacho--Sad index_ by $\CS_p(\cal{F},C)=-\frac{-1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma\frac{\eta}{h}$, where $\gamma$ is a loop around $p$ on $\{f=0\}$.
We define $\CS(\cal{F},C)=\sum_{p\in\Sing\cal{F}\cap C}\CS_p(\cal{F},C)$
The _Camacho--Sad index theorem_ [@5] says that
$$
  \CS(\cal{F},C) = C^2.
$$
Recall that a _reduced foliation_ $\cal{F}$ is a foliation such that every singularity $p$ is reduced in the sense of Seidenberg, i.e., for every vector field $X$ generating $\cal{F}$, and for every singular point $p$ of $X$, the eigenvalues of the linear part of $X$ are not both zero, and their quotient, when defined, is not a positive rational number.
If one eigenvalue is zero and the other is not, then the singularity is said to be a **TO-DO: knot saddle?**.

::: {.rmenv #definition-1 title="Definition 1" latex="{Definition 1}"}
Let $\cal{F}$ be a foliation on a complex surface $S$, and let $\cal{G}$ be an arbitrary reduced foliation that is bimeromorphically equivalent to $\cal{F}$.
The _Kodaira dimension_ of $\cal{F}$ is given by
$$
  \Kod(\cal{F}) = \limsup_{n\to\infty} \frac{\log h^0(S,K_\cal{G}^{\otimes=n})}{\log n}.
$$
