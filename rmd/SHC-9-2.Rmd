The aim of this talk is to generalise certain theorems of Serre.
It makes fundamental use of the techniques of Serre [@1; @2; @3].


# Generalities on coherent algebraic sheaves {#section-1}

Let $X$ be a topological space endowed with a sheaf of rings $\scr{O}$.
A sheaf of $\scr{O}$-modules $\scr{A}$ (or simply an $\scr{O}$-module) is said to be *of finite type* if, on every small-enough open subset, it is isomorphic to a quotient of $\scr{O}^n$ (for some finite integer $n\geq0$), and *coherent* if it is of finite type and if, for every homomorphism $\scr{O}^m\to\scr{A}$ on an open subset $U$ of $X$, the kernel is of finite type.
If $0\to\scr{A}'\to\scr{A}\to\scr{A}''\to0$ is an exact sequence of $\scr{O}$-modules, and if two of the modules are coherent, then so too is the third;
the kernel, cokernel, image, and coimage of a homomorphism of coherent $\scr{O}$-modules is a coherent $\scr{O}$-module.
If $\scr{A}$ and $\scr{B}$ are coherent $\scr{O}$-modules, then so too is the sheaf $\shHom_\scr{O}(\scr{A},\scr{B})$ of germs of homomorphisms from $\scr{A}$ to $\scr{B}$.
If $\scr{O}$ itself is coherent, then coherent $\scr{O}$-modules are exactly the $\scr{O}$-modules that, on small-enough open subsets, are isomorphic to the cokernel of some homomorphism $\scr{O}^m\to\scr{O}^n$.
For all of this, and other elementary properties, see [@1, chapitre 1, paragraphe 2].

Let $X$ be an algebraic set (over an algebraically closed field $k$, to illustrate the idea; but the results of this talk still hold true for schemes, and even for general arithmetic schemes...).
We denote by $\scr{O}_X$ the structure sheaf of $X$, with its sections over an open subset $U\subset X$ being the regular functions on $U$.
This is a sheaf of rings, and even of $k$-algebras.

—

a. $\scr{O}_X$ is a coherent sheaf of rings.
b. If $X$ is affine with coordinate ring $A(X)$, then, for every coherent $\scr{O}$-module $\scr{A}$ on $X$, the stalks $\scr{A}_x$ are generated by the canonical image of $\Gamma(X,\scr{A})$.
    Furthermore, $\Gamma(X,\scr{A})$ is an $A(X)$-module of finite type, and every $A(X)$-module of finite type comes from an essentially unique coherent $\scr{O}$-module.
    (Recall that $\Gamma(X,\scr{A})$ denotes the module of sections of $\scr{A}$ over $X$).
c. Under the conditions of b), we have that $\HH^i(X,\scr{A})=0$ for $i>0$.

# A dévissage theorem {#section-2}

::: {.rmenv #definition-1 title="Definition 1" latex="{Definition 1}"}
Let $\cal{C}$ be an abelian category, and $\cal{C}'$ a subclass of $\cal{C}$.
We say that $\cal{C}'$ is an *exact subcategory* if, for every exact sequence $0\to\scr{A}'\to\scr{A}\to\scr{A}''\to0$ in $\cal{C}$ with two (non-zero) terms in $\cal{C}'$, the third term is also in $\cal{C}'$, and if every direct factor of any $\scr{A}\in\cal{C}'$ is also in $\cal{C}'$.
:::

::: {.itenv #theorem-2 title="Theorem 2" latex="{Theorem 2}"}
Let $X$ be an algebraic set;
suppose that, for every irreducible subset $Y$ of $X$, we are given a coherent $\scr{O}_Y$-module $\scr{F}_Y$ on $Y$ that has support equal to $Y$.
Let $K(X)$ be the abelian category of coherent algebraic sheaves on $X$.
Then every *exact* subcategory $\cal{K}$ of $K(X)$ containing the $\scr{F}_Y$ is identical to $K(X)$.
:::

:::: {.proof}
The proof is done by induction on $n=\dim X$, with the case $n=0$ being immediate, by the second condition of [Definition 1](#definition-1).
So suppose that $n>0$, and that the theorem is true in dimension $<n$.
We can consider $K(Y)$ as a subcategory of $K(X)$ (where $Y$ is some given closed subset of $X$), and then $\cal{K}\cap K(Y)$ is a subcategory of $K(Y)$ satisfying the conditions of [Theorem 2](#theorem-2), and so, if $\dim Y<n$, then the induction hypothesis implies that $K(Y)=K(Y)\cap\cal{K}$, i.e. $K(Y)\subset\cal{K}$.

::: {.itenv title="Lemma 1" latex="{Lemma 1}"}
Let $Y$ be a closed subset of $X$, and $\scr{A}$ a coherent $\scr{O}_X$-module such that $\supp\scr{A}\subset Y$.
Let $\scr{I}_Y$ be the sheaf of ideals of $\scr{O}_X$ defined by $Y$.
Then there exists an integer $k$ such that $\scr{I}_Y^k\scr{A}=0$.
:::

::: {.proof}
By "compactness" reasons, we can restrict to the case where $X$ is affine, and then apply part (b) of [Theorem 1](#theorem-1), noting that, if $\scr{A}$ is defined by the $A(X)$-module $M=\Gamma(X,\scr{A})$, then the ideal of $\supp\scr{A}$ is the intersection of the minimal prime ideals associated to the annihilator of $M$, whence the result.
:::

::: {.itenv #corollary-1 title="Corollary" latex="{Corollary}"}
Under the above conditions, $\scr{A}$ admits a composition series with each composition factor $\scr{A}_i/\scr{A}_{i+1}$ lying in $K(Y)$.
:::

This implies that $\scr{A}_i/\scr{A}_{i+1}$ is annihilated by $\scr{I}_Y$;
we take $\scr{A}_i=\scr{I}_Y^i\scr{A}$.
In the case where $\dim Y<n$, by induction on the length of
this composition series, using [Definition 1](#definition-1) and the fact that $K(Y)\subset\cal{K}$, we see that, *if $\dim\supp\scr{A}<n$, then $\scr{A}\in\cal{K}$.*

\oldpage{2-03}
Suppose first of all that $X$ is irreducible.
For $\scr{A}\in K(X)$, let $T(\scr{A})$ be the torsion submodule of $\scr{A}$ (whose stalks are the torsion submodules of $\scr{A}_x$).

::: {.itenv #lemma-2 title="Lemma 2" latex="{Lemma 2}"}
If $\scr{A}\in K(X)$, then the torsion submodule $T(\scr{A})$ is also in $K(X)$, and $\scr{A}=T(\scr{A})$ if and only if $\supp\scr{A}\neq X$.
:::

::: {.proof}
We can immediately restrict to the case where $X$ is affine, where it is evident, by the interpretation of coherent $\scr{O}$-modules as $A(X)$-modules of finite type.
:::

Using the exact sequence $0\to T(\scr{A})\to \scr{A}\to \scr{A}_0\to 0$, and that $T(\scr{A})\in\cal{K}$, we see that $\scr{A}\in\cal{K}$ if and only if $\scr{A}_0\in\cal{K}$.

Let $\scr{R}$ be the sheaf of fields over $X$ given by the fields of fractions of the $\scr{O}_{X,x}$, i.e. the sheaf of germs of rational functions, which is a constant sheaf, and we have an injective homomorphism $\scr{A}_0\to\scr{A}_0\otimes_{\scr{O}_X}\scr{R}$
Representing $\scr{A}_0$ locally as the cokernel of a homomorphism $\scr{O}_X^m\to\scr{O}_X^{m'}$, we see that the tensor product $\scr{A}_0\otimes_{\scr{O}_X}\scr{R}$ is locally isomorphic (as sheaves of $\scr{R}$-modules) to a sheaf of the form $\scr{R}^k$, and thus conclude that it is *globally* isomorphic to $\scr{R}^k$ thanks to:

::: {.itenv #lemma-3 title="Lemma 3" latex="{Lemma 3}"}
On any irreducible algebraic set $X$, every locally constant sheaf is constant.
:::

::: {.proof}
This is an easy consequence of the fact that every open subset of $X$ is connected (consider a maximal open subset where the sheaf in question is constant!).
:::

We will thus identify $\scr{A}_0\otimes_{\scr{O}_X}\scr{R}$ with some $\scr{R}^k$, which contains the sub-$\scr{O}_X$-module $\scr{O}_X^k$.
Consider the exact sequence
$$
  0 \to \scr{A}_0 \to \scr{A}_0+\scr{O}_X^k \to \scr{Q} \to 0
$$
where $\scr{Q}$ is defined as the cokernel of the injection homomorphism.
We immediately see that $\scr{Q}\otimes_{\scr{O}}\scr{R}=0$, and so $\scr{Q}$ is a torsion module, and so $\supp\scr{Q}\neq X$ ([Lemma 2](#lemma-2)), whence $\scr{Q}\in\cal{K}$.
(We implicitly make use of the fact that $\scr{A}_0+\scr{O}_X^k$ is a coherent $\scr{O}$-module, which can be easily verified).
Then $\scr{A}_0\in\cal{K}$ *if and only if* $\scr{A}_0+\scr{O}_X^k\in\cal{K}$.
\oldpage{2-04}
Similarly, the analogous exact sequence $0\to\scr{O}_X^k\to\scr{A}_0+\scr{O}_X^k\to\scr{Q}'\to0$, where $\supp\scr{Q}\neq X$, and whence $\scr{Q}'\in\cal{K}$, implies that $\scr{A}_0+\scr{O}_X^k\in\cal{K}$ *if and only if* $\scr{O}_X^k\in\cal{K}$.
Finally, suppose that $k>0$, i.e. that $\scr{A}$ is not a torsion $\scr{O}$-module, i.e. that $\supp\scr{A}=X$;
then $\scr{O}_X^k\in\cal{K}$ *if and only if* $\scr{O}_X\in\cal{K}$, as follows immediately from [Definition 1](#definition-1).
So the above "if and only if"s imply that, if $\scr{A}$ is such that $\supp\scr{A}\neq X$, then $\scr{A}\in\cal{K}$ *if and only if* $\scr{O}_X\in\cal{K}$.
Taking $\scr{A}=\scr{F}_X$, we thus see that $\scr{O}_X\in\cal{K}$, whence every $\scr{A}\in K(X)$ with support equal to $X$ is in $\cal{K}$, and since the same is true for the $\scr{A}\in K(X)$ with suppose not equal to $X$, we indeed have that $K(X)\subseteq\cal{K}$.

Now, if $X$ is not necessarily irreducible, let $X_i$ be its irreducible components.
For every coherent algebraic sheaf $\scr{A}$ on $X$, let $A_i$ be the sheaf that agrees with $\scr{A}$ on $X_i$, and with $0$ on $X\setminus X_i$;
then $\scr{A}_i$ is a coherent $\scr{O}$-module that can be identified with a quotient of $\scr{A}$.
We have a natural homomorphism $\scr{A}\to\coprod_i\scr{A}_i$ from $\scr{A}$ to the direct sum of the $\scr{A}_i$ that is *injective*;
let $\scr{Q}$ be its cokernel;
we thus have an exact sequence $0\to\scr{A}\to\coprod_i\scr{A}_i\to\scr{Q}\to0$.
Since $\supp\scr{Q}\subset\bigcup_{i\neq j}X_i\cap X_j$, we have that $\scr{Q}\in\cal{K}$;
to prove that $\scr{A}\in\cal{K}$, it suffices to prove that $\coprod_i\scr{A}_i\in\cal{K}$, or even that each $\scr{A}_i$ is in $\cal{K}$.
But, by what we have already seen, applied to $X_i$, we have that $K(X_i)\in\cal{K}$, whence we again conclude that $\supp\scr{A}_i\subset X_i$ implies that $\scr{A}_i\in\cal{K}$, by using the [Corollary of Lemma 1](#corollary-1).
This proves [Theorem 2](#theorem-2).
::::

::: {.rmenv title="Remark" latex="{Remark}"}
We say that the subcategory $\cal{K}$ of $K(X)$ is *left exact* if, for every exact sequence $0\to\scr{A}'\to\scr{A}\to\scr{A}''\to0$ in $K(X)$, we have that $\scr{A}'$ (respectively $\scr{A}$) is in $\cal{K}$ provided that the two other terms are in $\cal{K}$.
The proof of [Theorem 2](#theorem-2) proves that the conclusion still holds true if we suppose that $\cal{K}$ is only left exact, *provided that* the $\scr{F}_Y$ considered as $\scr{O}_Y$-modules are torsion free.
This suffices to prove that, if $X$ is complete, then the $\Gamma(X,\scr{A})$, for $\scr{A}\in K(X)$, are vector spaces of finite dimension (since the category $\cal{K}$ of $\scr{A}\in K(X)$ having this property is left exact, and contains the $\scr{O}_Y$): this is the proof by Serre.
