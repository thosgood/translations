# I. (December 1948)

\oldpage{7}
The homology and cohomology of a _compact_ Lie group can be directly studied via the Lie algebra of the group (cf. Chevalley and Eilenberg, "Cohomology theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras", _Trans. Amer. Math. Soc_ **63** (1948), 85--124).
Proceeding like so, we can study Lie algebras over an arbitrary field (most often of characteristic zero);
the compactness hypotheses are then replaced with _semi-simplicity_ hypotheses.
The current conference aims to explain certain algebraic tools that are useful for this study, and to prove the first results obtained (notably the theorem on the third Betti number).
In a later conference, we will introduce notions concerning a sub-algebra of a Lie algebra, and its corresponding "homogeneous space".

## General notions {#I.1}

Denoting an operator on a set $A$ (that is, a transformation from $A$ to $A$) by an arbitrary letter, such as $T$, we write $T\cdot x$ to mean the transformation of $x\in A$ under $T$, and $TU$ to mean the composition of operators $T$ and $U$, so that $TU\cdot x = T\cdot (U\cdot x)$.

## Notions concerning the exterior algebra {#I.2}
