# Introduction {#zero .unnumbered}

\oldpage{1}
If $X$ is a (non-singular) complex-analytic manifold, then there is an equivalence between the notions of

a. local systems of complex vectors on $X$ ; and
b. vector bundles on $X$ endowed with an integrable connection.

The latter of these two notions can be adapted in an evident way to the case where $X$ is a non-singular algebraic variety over a field $k$ (which we will take here to be of characteristic $0$).
However, general algebraic vector bundles with integrable connections are pathological (see [(II.6.19)](#II.6.19));
we only obtain a reasonable theory if we impose a "regularity" condition at infinity.
By a theorem of Griffiths [@8], this condition is automatically satisfied for "Gauss-Manin connections" (see [(II.7)](#II.7)).
In dimension one, this is closely linked to the idea of regular singular points of a differential equation (see [(I.4)](#I.4) and [(II.1)](#II.1)).

In Chapter I, we explain the different forms that the notion of an integrable connection can take.
In Chapter II, we prove the fundamental facts concerning regular connections.
In Chapter III, we translate certain results that we have obtained into the language of Nilsson class functions, and, as an application of the regularity theorem (see [(II.7)](#II.7)), we explain the proof by Brieskorn [@5] of the monodromy theorem.

These notes came from the non-crystalline part of a seminar given at Harvard during the autumn of 1969, under the title: "Regular singular differential equations and crystalline cohomology".

I thank the assistants of this seminar, who had to be subjected to often unclear talks, and who allowed me to find numerous simplifications.

I also thank N. Katz, with whom I had numerous and useful conversations, and to whom are due the principal results of section [(II.1)](#II.1).

## Notation and terminology {-}

\oldpage{2}
Within a single chapter, the references follow the decimal system.
A reference to a different chapter (resp. to the current introduction) is preceded by the Roman numeral of the chapter (resp. by 0).

We will use the following definitions:

::: {.rmenv #zero.1 title="0.1" latex="{0.1}"}
_analytic space_:
the analytic spaces are complex and of locally-finite dimension;
they are assumed to be $\sigma$-compact, but not necessarily separated.
:::

::: {.rmenv #zero.2 title="0.2" latex="{0.2}"}
_multiform function_:
a synonym for multivalued function --- for a precise definition, see [(I.6.2)](#I.6.2).
:::

::: {.rmenv #zero.3 title="0.3" latex="{0.3}"}
_immersion_:
following the tradition of algebraic geometers, immersion is a synonym for "embedding".
:::

::: {.rmenv #zero.4 title="0.4" latex="{0.4}"}
_smooth_:
a morphism $f\colon X\to S$ of analytic spaces is smooth if, locally on $X$, it is isomorphic to the projection from $D^n\times S$ to $S$, where $D^n$ is an open polydisc.
:::

::: {.rmenv #zero.5 title="0.5" latex="{0.5}"}
_locally paracompact_:
a topological space is locally paracompact if every point has a paracompact neighbourhood (and thus a fundamental system of paracompact neighbourhoods).
:::

::: {.rmenv #zero.6 title="0.6" latex="{0.6}"}
non-singular (or smooth) _complex algebraic variety_:
a smooth scheme of finite type over $\Spec(\mathbb{C})$.
:::

::: {.rmenv #zero.7 title="0.7" latex="{0.7}"}
(complex) _analytic manifold_:
a non-singular (or smooth) analytic space.
:::

::: {.rmenv #zero.8 title="0.8" latex="{0.8}"}
_covering_:
following the tradition of topologists, a covering is a continuous map $f\colon X\to Y$ such that every point $y\in Y$ has a neighbourhood $V$ such that $f|V$ is isomorphic to the projection from $F\times V$ to $V$, where $F$ is discrete.

# (PART) Dictionary {#I}

\oldpage{3}
In this chapter, we explain the relations between various aspects and various uses of the notion of "local systems of complex vectors".
The equivalence between the points of view considered has been well known for a long time.

We do not consider the "crystalline" point of view;
see [@4; @10].

# Local systems and the fundamental group {#I.1}

::: {.rmenv #I.1.1 title="Definition 1.1" latex="{Definition 1.1}"}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
A _complex local system_ on $X$ is a sheaf of complex vectors on $X$ that, locally on $X$, is isomorphic to a constant sheaf $\mathbb{C}^n$ (n$\in\mathbb{N}$).
