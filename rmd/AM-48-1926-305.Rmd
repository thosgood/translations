The Riemann $\xi$-function, defined by the formula
\oldpage{305}
$$
  \xi(iz)
  =
  \frac12 \left(
    z^2 - \frac14
  \right) \pi^{-\frac{z}{2}-\frac14} \Gamma \left(
    \frac{z}{2} + \frac14
  \right) \zeta \left(
    \frac12 + z
  \right),
\tag{1}
$$
was represented by Riemann himself by an infinite trigonometric integral, namely^[B. Riemann, Werke (1876), S. 138.]
$$
  \xi(z) = 2\int_0^\infty \Phi(u)\cos(zu)\dd u
\tag{2}
$$
$$
  \Phi(u) = 2\pi e^{\frac{5u}{2}} \sum_{n=1}^\infty (2\pi e^{2u}n^2 - 3) n^2 e^{-n^2\pi e^{2u}}.
\tag{3}
$$
It is evident that
$$
  \Phi(u) \sim 4\pi^2 e^{\frac{9u}{2}-\pi e^{2u}}
  \quad\text{as }u\to+\infty.
\tag{4}
$$
Furthermore (see [§4](#section-4)), $\Phi(u)$ is an even function.
Therefore
$$
  \Phi(u) \sim 4\pi^2 \left(
    e^{\frac{9u}{2}} + e^{-\frac{9u}{2}}
  \right) e^{-\pi(e^{2u}+e^{-2u})}
  \quad\text{as }u\to\pm\infty.
\tag{5}
$$

\oldpage{306}
With regards to the Riemann hypothesis, one could ask the following question^[This was casually mentioned by Prof. Landau in a conversation in 1913.]: does the function given by replacing $\Phi(u)$ in the right-hand side of Equation (2) with the right-hand side of Equation (4) have only real zeros?

The answer is no (see [§4](#section-4)): the resulting function has infinitely many imaginary zeros.
If, however, the right-hand side of Equation (5) is used, instead of the right-hand side of Equation (4), then we obtain the function
$$
  \xi^*(z) = 8\pi^2 \int_0^\infty \left(
    e^{\frac{9u}{2}} + e^{-\frac{9u}{2}}
  \right) e^{-\pi(e^{2u}+e^{-2u})} \cos(zu) \dd u,
\tag{6}
$$
which one could call the "modified $\xi$-function", and $\xi^*(z)$ in fact *has only real zeros*.
Incidentally,
$$
  \xi(z) \sim \xi^*(z)
$$
if $z$ tends towards $\infty$ in some closed ray based at the point $0$ and not containing the real axis.
If we denote by $N(r)$ the number of zeros of $\xi(z)$ in the circular region $|z|\leq r$, and by $N^*(r)$ the number of zeros of $\xi^*(z)$ in the same region, then
$$
  N(r) \sim N^*(r)
$$
and even
$$
  N(r) - N^*(r) = O(\log r).
$$

In what follows, I provide a proof of the fact that all the zeros of $\xi^*(z)$ are real.
The proof focuses on another entire function, namely the function
$$
  \GG(z) = \GG(z;a) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{-a(e^u+e^{-u})+zu} \dd u,
\tag{7}
$$
which has some nice, simple properties.
The parameter $a$ is always a positive value.
We can express $\xi^*(z)$ in terms of $\GG(z)$.
\oldpage{307}
Indeed,
$$
  \xi^*(z) = 2\pi^2 \left\{
    \GG\left(
      \frac{iz}{2} - \frac94; \pi
    \right) +
    \GG\left(
      \frac{iz}{2} + \frac94; \pi
    \right)
  \right\}
\tag{8}
$$
as one can easily derive from Equations (6) and (7).
I will show that $\GG(iz)$ *has only real zeros*.
From this, the same property then easily follows for $\xi^*(z)$.


# 1 {.unnumbered #section-1}

The most important property of the entire function $\GG(z)$ is that is satisfies a simple difference equation;
namely
$$
  z\GG(z) = a(\GG(z+1) - \GG(z-1))
\tag{9}
$$
as can easily be proven by partial integration.
Note also that $\GG(z)$ is even:
$$
  \GG(-z) = \GG(z).
\tag{10}
$$
Furthermore, if $z$ is not an integer, then
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \GG(z)
    &= a^{-z}\Gamma(z) \left(
      1 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{a^{2n}}{n!(1-z)(2-z)\ldots(n-z)}
    \right)
  \\&+ a^z\Gamma(-z) \left(
      1 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{a^{2n}}{n!(1+z)(2+z)\ldots(n+z)}
    \right).
  \end{aligned}
\tag{11}
$$

The proof of Equation (11) goes as follows: write
$$
  \Gamma(z)
  = \int_0^a e^{-v} v^{z-1} \dd v + \int_a^\infty e^{-v} v^{z-1} \dd v
  = P(z) + Q(z),
\tag{12}
$$
$$
  P(z) = P(z;a) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n a^{z+n}}{n!(z+n)},
\tag{13}
$$
$$
  Q(z) = Q(z;a) = a^z \int_0^\infty e^{-ae^u+uz} \dd u.
\tag{14}
$$

Now,
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \GG(z)
    &= \int_0^\infty e^{-a(e^u+e^{-u})} (e^{uz}+e^{-uz}) \dd u
  \\&= \int_0^\infty \sum_{n=0}^\infty e^{-ae^u} \frac{(-a)^n}{n!} (e^{(-n+z)u}+e^{(-n-z)u}) \dd u.
  \end{aligned}
$$
From this it follows, by Equation (14), after exchanging the order of summation and integration (which can easily be justified by absolute convergence), that
\oldpage{308}
$$
  \GG(z)
  = a^{-z}\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n a^{2n}}{n!} Q(-n+z)
  + a^z\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n a^{2n}}{n!} Q(-n-z).
\tag{15}
$$
On the other hand, evidently
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    0
    &= \sum_{k=0}^\infty \sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{k+l}a^{k+l}}{k!l!} \left(
      \frac{1}{-k+z+l} + \frac{1}{k-z-l}
    \right)
  \\&= a^{-z} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^ka^{2k}}{k!} \sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^la^{-k+z+l}}{l!(-k+z+l)}
  \\&+ a^z \sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^la^{2l}}{l!} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^ka^{-l-z+k}}{k!(-l-z+k)}
  \end{aligned}
$$
and so, by Equation (13),
$$
  \GG(z)
  = a^{-z} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^ka^{2k}}{k!} P(-k+z)
  + a^z \sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^la^{2l}}{l!} P(-l-z).
\tag{16}
$$
It follows from Equations (12), (15), and (16) that
$$
  \GG(z)
  = a^{-z} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^na^{2n}}{n!} \Gamma(-n+z)
  + a^z \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^na^{2n}}{n!} \Gamma(-n-z),
$$
which is equivalent to Equation (11).

I will also state here, without proof, the two following representations, which will not be used in what follows:
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \GG(z)
    &= \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{a-i\infty}^{a+i\infty} \Gamma\left(
      s - \frac{z}{2}
    \right) \Gamma \left(
      s + \frac{z}{2}
    \right) a^{-2s} \dd s,
  \\\GG(z)
    &= \frac{\pi}{\sin(\pi z)} e^{\frac{i\pi z}{2}} J_{-z}(2ia) - \frac{\pi}{\sin(\pi z)} e^{-\frac{i\pi z}{2}} J_z(2ia).
  \end{aligned}
$$
In the first one, $2a>|\Re z|$; in the second, both terms on the right-hand side satisfy the same difference equation, which is also satisfied by $\GG(z)$, by Equation (9).


# 2 {.unnumbered #section-2}

The asymptotic representation and the estimates of $\GG(z)$, with which we now concern ourselves, can be obtained by expanding Equation (11).

\oldpage{309}
Different areas of the $z$-plane have to be examined on a case-by-case basis.
Fix $z = x+iy + re^{i\varphi}$, where $x$, $y$, $r$, and $\varphi$ are real; $r\geq0$; if $y>0$, then we assume that $0<\varphi<\pi$; $x-iy = \overline{z}$.


## I {.unnumbered #I}

*For $|y|\geq1$ and $a\leq A$,*
$$
  \GG(z)
  = a^{-z} \Gamma(z) \left(
    1 + \frac{\chi(z)}{z}
  \right) + a^z \Gamma(z) \left(
    1 - \frac{\chi(-z)}{z}
  \right)
\tag{17}
$$
*where the absolute value of the function $\chi(z)=\chi(z;a)$ is bounded above by a value depending only on $A$.*

We know, by Equation (11), that
$$
  \chi(z)
  = \frac{za^2}{1-z} \left(
    1 + \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{a^{2n-2}}{n!(2-z)(3-z)\ldots(n-z)}
  \right)
$$
whence, without further ado, the claim.


## II {.unnumbered #II}

*Let $\varepsilon$ and $A$ be fixed positive numbers.*
*Set*
$$
  \frac{a^z\GG(z)}{\Gamma(z)} - 1
  = \psi(z) = \psi(z;a).
\tag{18}
$$
*Then, in the half-plane $x\geq\varepsilon$,*
$$
  \lim_{|z|\to\infty} \psi(z) = 0,
\tag{19}
$$
*and, in fact, if $a\leq A$, then this convergence is uniform in $z$ and $a$.*

It follows, from Stirling's formula, that there exists some constant $C$ such that, for $y\geq1$, $x\geq\varepsilon$, and $r\geq ae$,
$$
  \left\vert
    a^{2z} \frac{\Gamma(-z)}{\Gamma(z)}
  \right\vert \leq a^{2x}Cr^{-2x}e^{-(\pi-2\varphi)y+2x}
  \leq C\left(
    \frac{ae}{r}
  \right)^{2\varepsilon}.
\tag{20}
$$
In the part of the half-plane where $x\geq\varepsilon$, where $y\geq1$, claim (II) follows directly from Equations (17), (18), and (20);
it also follows, by symmetry, in the part where $y\leq-1$.
Then the only remaining part is the half-strip
$$
  x\geq\varepsilon,
  \quad -1\leq y\leq 1.
$$
By the already-proven part of claim (II), Equation (18) tends to zero as $z\to\infty$.
\oldpage{310}
Since Equation (18) is entire and of finite order, by well-known general theorems^[See G. Pólya and G. Szegö, Aufgaben und Lehrsätze aus der Analysis (Berlin 1925), Bd. 1, Aufgaben III 333, III 339.], it must tend uniformly to zero in the entire half-strip as $z\to\infty$;
this completes the proof of claim (II).
Of course, instead of using general theorems, Equation (18) could also be used on suitable curves intersecting the half-strip, e.g. to estimate on the straight lines $x=k+\frac12$, for $k=0,1,2,3,\ldots$.
In the case where $k=0$, we investigate such an estimation for a different purpose, c.f. Equation (22).


## III (.unnumbered #III)

*If $a\leq\frac14$, then there are no zeros of $\GG(z;a)$ outside of the strip $-\frac12<x<\frac12$.*

Since $\GG(z)$ is even, it suffices to consider the half-plane $x\geq\frac12$.
On the straight line $x=\frac12$,
$$
  z+\overline{z} = 1,
  \quad \overline{z} = 1-z
$$
and so, by the symmetry of the values with respect to the real axis,
$$
  |\Gamma(1-z)| = |\Gamma(z)|,
$$
whence
$$
  \left\vert
    \frac{\Gamma(-z)}{\Gamma(z)}
  \right\vert = \left\vert
    \frac{\Gamma(1-z)}{-z\Gamma(z)}
  \right\vert = \frac{1}{|z|} \leq 2
  \qquad\left(
    x=\frac12
  \right).
\tag{21}
$$
Using Equation (21), it follows from Equation (11) that, on the straight line $x=\frac12$,
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    |\psi(z)|
    &= \left\vert
      \frac{a^z\GG(z)}{\Gamma(z)} - 1
    \right\vert
  \\&= \left\vert
      \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{a^{2n}}{n!(1-z)\ldots(n-z)}
      + \frac{a^{2z}\Gamma(-z)}{\Gamma(z)} \left(
        1 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{a^{2n}}{n!(1+z)\ldots(n+z)}
      \right)
    \right\vert
  \\&\leq \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{a^{2n}}{n!\frac12\cdot\frac32\cdot\ldots\cdot\frac{2n-1}{2}} + a\cdot2 \left(
    1 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{a^{2n}}{n!\frac32\cdot\frac52\cdot\ldots\cdot\frac{2n+1}{2}}
  \right)
  \\&= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(2a)^{2n}}{(2n)!} + \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(2a)^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}
  \\&= e^{2a}-1.
  \end{aligned}
\tag{22}
$$
\oldpage{311}
It then follows from Equation (22) that
$$
  |\psi(z)| = |\psi(z;a)| < 1
  \qquad\text{for }x=\frac12$ and $a\leq\frac14.
\tag{23}
$$
It follows from claim (II) that there exists some number $R$ such that
$$
  |\psi(z)| = |\psi(z;a)| <1
  \qquad\text{for }x\geq\frac12\text{, }r\geq R\text{, and }a\leq\frac14.
\tag{24}
$$
Furthermore, $|\psi(z)|<1$ is also satisfied in the circle segment $\{x\geq\frac12,r\leq R\}$, since the inequality in question, by Equations (23) and (24), is satisfied on the boundary of the circle segment.
Thus $|\psi(z)|<1$ is satisfied in the whole half-plane $x\geq\frac12$;
thus $\GG(z)$, cf. Equation (18), does not disappear in this half-plane.

For what follows, it is useful to have in mind a certain partition of the plane (cf. the above figure): the strip $-1\leq x\leq 1$ is denoted by $\SS$; the part of the plane where both $r\leq R$ and $|x|>1$ is denoted by $\TT$; the remaining part, which extends to infinity, is denoted by $\UU$.
We pick the number $R=R(A)$ depending on a certain positive number $A$ such that, inside, and on the boundary of, $\UU$, the inequality $|\psi(z)|<1$ is satisfied for $a\leq A$.
From Equation (18) it follows that $\GG(z)$ does not vanish inside, or on the boundary of, $\UU$.
