### To-do list

- (PDF) header on title page
- (PDF) subtitle (e.g. FGA-3-I)
- (HTML) `favicon` (in YAML metadata)
- (HTML) katex in section title appears twice in TOC
  + also in title in header (if title contains katex)
- (HTML) reading progress bar
- (HTML) previews of (internal) links on hover?
  + if so, **definitely** have a way of disabling this (ideally in the header bar, alongside e.g. TOC toggle button)
- (BOTH) git commit version
  + include link to `.Rmd` source file on github
