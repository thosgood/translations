### TODO

- remove `\cref`s from all papers
- remove `\cref`s from all in-progress files
- just two theorem environments
    + one plain, one definition
    + optional argument for name (e.g. Theorem)
    + optional argument for number (e.g. 1.7.3)
        * actually maybe have four environments, with starred versions for no number?
- `\usepackage{geometry}`
