### To-do list

- move `clever_git_pull` into this repo

- (PDF) header on title page
- (HTML) `favicon` (in YAML metadata)
- (HTML) latex in section title appears twice in TOC
  + also in title in header (if title contains latex)
- (HTML) link to github copy of Rmd source ("source" metadata)
- (HTML) make `download: ["pdf"]` in `_output.yml` work somehow...
  + need to rename the pdf halfway through the `build.R` process, before starting the gitbook build
- (HTML) reading progress bar
- (HTML) previews of (internal) links on hover?
  + if so, **definitely** have a way of disabling this (ideally in the header bar, alongside e.g. TOC toggle button)
- (BOTH) git commit version
